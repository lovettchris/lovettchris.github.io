      <h1 id="connecting-nrf5340-audio-devkit-to-pixel-8-android-phone">Connecting nrf5340 audio devkit to Pixel 8 Android Phone</h1>
<p>I was able to stream audio from my Pixel 8 phone phone running Android 14 to my <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF5340-Audio-DK">nrf5340 audio devkit</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="music" src="music.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here you see the bluetooth pairing showing the phone connected to the devkit:</p>
<p><img alt="pairing" src="pairing.jpg" /></p>
<p>First you build the firmware as a headset with CONFIG_AUDIO_DEV=1 flash the firmware and ensure
it is advertising. You should see this in the console output:</p>

<p>Next on the Android phone you may need to enable developer mode, then make sure <code>Disable Bluetoioth LE audio</code> is not
enabled.  Then Click <code>Pair new device</code> under settings -&gt; Connected devices and look for the one named <code>NRF5340_AUDIO</code>
and click pair.  You should see <code>streamctrl_unicast_server: Connected</code> appear in the log.  </p>

<p>Here you can see it has negotiated a 24 kHz channel 1 stream. This is because I configured the 
nrf5340 devkit to run at 24kh because I was testing another device.  I&rsquo;m sure it would also work great
at 48 kHz.</p>
<p>Click on the paired device settings icon and enable the switch titled <code>LE Audio</code>.  Now open a youtube video and if the
audio is coming out of the phone speakers then click the volume button, and click settings, then change the <code>Play Chrome
on</code> button from This Phone to <code>NRF5340_AUDIO</code> device.</p>
<p>Note that the nrf5340 chip acts as one channel, since normally you would have 2 chips for each earbud. So you will only
get the left channel in this case.  You can use 2 nrf5340 audio devkits to get full stereo.</p>
<p>THe log will show <code>Data received</code> and perhaps some under runs, but it is working fine and the audio sounds great through
some earbuds.</p>
