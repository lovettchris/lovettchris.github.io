This data is persisted in DGML documents which is an XML format. While it is possible to edit the XML directly, it is not fun or productive. The Graph Model API provides an in-memory representation that is natural for manipulating directed graphs and has become the foundation of all the dependency analysis features in VS. For this reason the API has been made available anyone extending Visual Studio. Goals Performance: Being the platform for lots of features the model needs to be as fast as possible. Usability: Close behind however is the fact that the API needs to be simple to use Convenience: Where practical helper methods are provided for added convenience, but this is not the top priority of this API. Helper libraries can always be provided out of band or as sample code. Thread safe: Some amount of thread safety and thread isolation is nice for this level of API Non-Goals The API does not attempt to be the front end to a database. Design The Complete Graph Model API is available on MSDN. This spec just outlines the core concepts that must be understood in order to use this API. The Graph model can serialize itself to and from the DGML XML format. GraphNodeId In order to support first class serialization and decoupling of graph operations across components, or in databases, it is important to name the objects in a graph carefully. To this end the Graph Model does not use System.String to name things. The GraphNodeId class is used instead. GraphNodeId is a structured identifier that composes nested sets of Name=Value pairs, for example, you can create a GraphNodeId that points to an Assembly like this: GraphNodeId mscorlib = GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.AssemblyName, new Uri(typeof(string).Assembly.Location)); This serializes to the following string format: (Assembly=file:///C:/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/mscorlib.dll) Then you can name the System Namespace inside mscorlib by composing the following two names together: GraphNodeId system = mscorlib + GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.NamespaceName, \"System\"); Then you can name the String Class by adding on to the name of the namespace: GraphNodeId str = system + GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.TypeName, \"String\"); Then you can name the Join method by adding to the name of the class: GraphNodeId join = str + GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.Name, \"Join\"); The result is an identifier that remembers the structure you used to build the name and this structure can also be serialized to and from the following string format: (Assembly=file:///C:/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/mscorlib.dll Namespace=System Class=String Method=Join) This sort of composition of names allows the application to avoid having to do lots of expensive string parsing operations every time it needs a part of the name. It also provides hashing advantages so that comparing identifiers is a lot faster and the overall memory used is much less than using strings. As you can imagine, naming everything in mscorlib results in many redundant Assembly, Namespace, Class sub strings, so building up identifiers using string addition would be very expensive: string mscorlib = \u201cAssembly=file:///C:/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/mscorlib.dll\u201d; string system = mscorlib + \u201c Namespace=System\u201d; string stringClass = system + \u201c Type=String\u201d; string joinMethod = stringClass + \u201cMethod=Join\u201d; The following table shows the comparison between System.String and GraphNodeId in construction time, comparison and total memory usage measured using all the identifiers in System.Xml.Linq.dll (about 2000 identifiers) and about 4 million comparisons (comparing every identifier against every other). The construction time for the GraphNodeId\u2019s here is the worst case and assumes no reuse of in memory ids. For example, it recreates the Assembly id over and over rather than holding onto one GraphNodeId pointer for that assembly. This is not typically how the product code will work, but it is the worst case. It is how Serialization would work, so it essentially measures serialization load time. For that reason strings are faster to load, but you can see that memory usage and comparison time, GraphNodeId wins considerably, this is because GraphNodeId is \u201catomized\u201d, so that comparison can be a simple object reference comparison. Note: string.Intern doesn\u2019t help the string case here because every identifier is different, and string.Intern would add substantial hit to load time, which would make it slower than GraphNodeId. GraphNodeId registration is static so they employ a WeakReference system to garbage collect ids that are not used. GraphNodeId Value Types The GraphNodeId values can be any type that can be converted to/from a string using TypeConverter. However, the following types are well supported: String: \u201cNamespace=System.Collections\u201d. Uri: \u201cAssembly=file://mscorlib.dll\u201d. GraphNodeIdCollection: \u201cParentType=(Assembly=file://mscorlib.dll Namespace=System.Collections Type=ArrayList)\u201d. GraphNodeIdName The name part is a static object called a GraphNodeIdName . The name also determines the type of value that the GraphNodeId can contain, and how a string should be parsed back during string serialization. For example, Namespace will be registered as string, but assembly as URI: class CodeNames { public static GraphNodeIdName AssemblyName = GraphNodeIdName.Get(\"Assembly\", \"Assembly\", typeof(Uri)); public static GraphNodeIdName NamespaceName = GraphNodeIdName.Get(\"Namespace\", \"Namespace\", typeof(string)); public static GraphNodeIdName TypeName = GraphNodeIdName.Get(\"Type\", \"Type\", typeof(object)); public static GraphNodeIdName NameName = GraphNodeIdName.Get(\"Name\", \"Name\", typeof(String)); public static GraphNodeIdName GenericParameterCountName = GraphNodeIdName.Get(\"GenericParameterCount\", \"GenericParameterCount\", typeof(int)); public static GraphNodeIdName MemberName = GraphNodeIdName.Get(\"Member\", \"Member\", typeof(Object)); public static GraphNodeIdName OverloadingParametersName = GraphNodeIdName.Get(\"OverloadingParameters\", \"OverloadingParameters\", typeof(GraphNodeIdCollection)); } Notice the GraphNodeIdName objects are usually static so they can be shared by the whole process. There are also 3 special names for qualified identifiers. These are non-printed names, and are inferred during parsing. GraphNodeIdName.Nested \u2013 a list of GraphNodeIds \u201c(Assembly=file://mscorlib.dll Namespace=System Type=String)\u201d. The data type of a Nested value is always GraphNodeIdCollection. In the above case, there are 3 nested identifiers: Assembly, Namespace and Type. GraphNodeIdName.Array \u2013 represents a list of GraphNodeId\u2019s where each item in the list has the same type. For example, the arguments to a method each have the same type \u201cMethodParameter\u201d, so think of the array as a way to lift the \u201cMethodParameter\u201d part out of the list, so instead of (MethodParameter=Value MethodParameter=Value MethodParameter=Value) you can say MethodParameter=[Value, Value, Value]. The data type of Array value is always GraphNodeIdCollection \u2013 with homogeneousItems =true. GraphNodeIdName.Literal - \u201cBing!\u201d. The data type of a Literal is a String. If a GraphNodeId is being constructed through parsing, and a name is not currently registered, a new name will be registered with a data type of System.Object. If you want to reuse the same GraphNodeIdName in some places with a string value and in other places with a nested GraphNodeIdCollection then type the GraphNodeIdName as System.Object. Parsing & standard form A standard GraphNodeId always has a Nested outer GraphNodeId, with one or more GraphNodeId inside. A GraphNodeId that\u2019s not part of a nested qualified identifier is said to be a partial qualified identifier. This is why the following method is called GetPartial: GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.NamespaceName, \"System\"); returns \"Namespace=System\" To make this a standard identifier wrap it in a GetNested call: GraphNodeId id = GraphNodeId.GetNested( GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.NamespaceName, \"System\") ); This results in the following well formed identifier: \"(Namespace=System)\" This is important during parsing. Although it is possible to build a partial GraphNodeId using the .GetPartial() API, it is not possible to construct one using .Parse(). Instead, GraphNodeId.Parse(\u201cNamespace=System\u201d)will instead be parsed as a Literal: - id2 {Namespace=System} Microsoft.VisualStudio.GraphModel.GraphNodeId - LiteralValue \"Namespace=System\" string - Name {Literal} Microsoft.VisualStudio.GraphModel.GraphNodeIdName - Value \"Namespace=System\" object {string} This is simply so that the parsing rules are simple, predictable, and as fast as possible. Any GraphNodeID that is malformed will also be parsed as: \u201cName=Literal, Value=whatever\u201d Nesting The following shows how GraphNodeId can be nested to full identify not only a method, but all the fully qualified types of all the parameters. The method we will describe is the following from mscorlib: System.IEquatable<T>.Equals(System.IEquatable<T> other); First we create some basic partial identifiers that can be reused: GraphNodeId mscorlib = GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.AssemblyName, new Uri(typeof(string).Assembly.Location)); GraphNodeId system = GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.NamespaceName, \"System\"); GraphNodeId iequatable = GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.NameName, \"IEquatable\"); GraphNodeId equals = GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.NameName, \"Equals\"); Next we build a nested identifier representing the generic type IEquatable<T> , which is represented by combining a GenericParameterCountName of 1 with the name \u201cIEquatable\u201d. The fact that the generic parameter is called T does not need to be remembered here: GraphNodeId iequatableGeneric = GraphNodeId.GetNested(new GraphNodeId[] {iequatable, GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.GenericParameterCountName, 1) }); Now we can say TypeName=IEquatable<T> like this: GraphNodeId typeName = GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.TypeName, iequatableGeneric); Now we can describe the method parameters using this nested name: GraphNodeId methodParameters = GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.OverloadingParametersName, new GraphNodeIdCollection(true, GraphNodeId.GetNested(new GraphNodeId[] { mscorlib, system, typeName }))); Now we can describe the \u201cEquals\u201d method and it\u2019s parameters using this: GraphNodeId method = GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.MemberName, GraphNodeId.GetNested(new GraphNodeId[] { equals, methodParameters })); Now we can fully type the method by adding assembly, namespace and type GraphNodeId result = GraphNodeId.GetNested(new GraphNodeId[] { mscorlib, system, typeName, method }); This results in the following serialized identifier: (Assembly=\"file://c:/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/mscorlib.dll\" Namespace=System Type=(Name=IEquatable GenericParameterCount=1) Member=(Name=Equals OverloadingParameters=[(Assembly = \"file://c:/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/mscorlib.dll\" Namespace = System Type = (Name = IEquatable GenericParameterCount = 1))]))} Notice how in the construction of the GraphNodeId that many sub-parts can be shared across many GraphNodeIds and this is how it can achieve performance and memory wins. Core Model The core graph model begins with the container called Graph. You can simply create a new empty Graph object as follows: Graph graph = new Graph(); This object can also be serialized to and from disk using the Load/Save methods (See Serialization for details): Graph graph = Graph.Load(dgmlFile); A graph can contain Nodes and Links which you can add using the Nodes and Links collections: GraphNode a = graph.Nodes.GetOrCreate(\"a\"); GraphNode b = graph.Nodes.GetOrCreate(\"b\"); GraphLink link = graph.Links.GetOrCreate(a, b); This could be visualized as the following: The Graph model is fully editable, you can insert or delete any node or link, and all expected ripple effects are taken care of. For example, when you add a Link, both end point nodes are added automatically if they are not there. If you Remove a node, all Links connected to that node are removed automatically. In this way the Graph is always left in a valid state after any editing operation. Graph nodes and links cannot belong to multiple Graph objects at the same time. If you add a node to a different Graph than it was created in, then that will become an \u201cimport\u201d operation and a new GraphNode instance will be created. To that end there are many helper methods dealing with copying subsets of a Graph to and from other Graph objects. See Copy, ImportSubset and Merge methods. For improved performance you should always wrap edit operations in a GraphTransactionScope . This will be covered in more detail below. Categories & Properties The root Graph , GraphNode and GraphLink can all contain properties and categories. There is a common base class called GraphObject . GraphObject has a collection of Properties and Categories. For example, the following node has the category \u201cVegetable\u201d and the \u201cBackground\u201d property with the value \u201cGreen\u201d: <Node Id=\"A\" Label=\"Tree\" Category=\"Vegetable\" Background=\"Green\"/> And the following node has the category \u201cElement\u201d and a \u201cFontStyle\u201d property with value \u201cItalic\u201d: <Node Id=\"B\" Label=\"Water\" Category=\"Element\" FontStyle=\"Italic\"/> The following link has the category \u201cDrinks\u201d with a \u201cWeight\u201d property with the value \u201c5\u201d. <Link Source=\"A\" Target=\"B\" Category=\"Drinks\" Weight=\"5\" /> In code you get and set properties using the GetValue/SetValue/ClearValue methods, and you get or set categories using HasCategory and AddCategory, and RemoveCategory. Properties and Categories can be used for all sorts of things. The GraphModel itself has some special built in properties and categories used to describe some things like grouping. GraphCategory and GraphProperty can also contain extra metadata describing what they are about. You could think of a GraphCategory as a property that has no value. But categories have one other feature, namely, GraphObject can inherit properties defined on the GraphCategory and categories can inherit properties from other categories via a BasedOn property. This allows you to setup loose taxonomies using this metadata system. For example, we can promote the Backgound and FontStyle properties to the GraphCategory and thereby every node that has the Category=\u201dVegetable\u201d will be italic and every node with the Category=\u201dElement\u201d will be blue. <Category Id=\"Element\" Background=\"Blue\" /> <Category Id=\"Plant\" FontStyle=\"Italic\" /> Now anything with the category Plant will have a tree icon, including anything that has the category Tree, since the Tree category is \u201cBasedOn\u201d the Plant category. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <DirectedGraph GraphDirection=\"LeftToRight\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/vs/2009/dgml\"> <Nodes> <Node Id=\"A\" Category=\"Tree\" Label=\"Tree\" /> <Node Id=\"B\" Category=\"Element\" Label=\"Water\" /> </Nodes> <Links> <Link Source=\"A\" Target=\"B\" /> </Links> <Categories> <Category Id=\"Element\" Background=\"#FF0000FF\" /> <Category Id=\"Plant\" FontStyle=\"Italic\" /> <Category Id=\"Tree\" Icon=\"Tree.png\" BasedOn=\"Plant\" Shape=\"None\" /> </Categories> <Properties> <Property Id=\"Background\" Label=\"Background\" Description=\"The background color\" DataType=\"System.Windows.Media.Brush\" /> <Property Id=\"GraphDirection\" DataType=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Diagrams.Layout.LayoutOrientation\" /> <Property Id=\"Icon\" Label=\"Icon\" Description=\"Icon\" DataType=\"System.String\" /> <Property Id=\"Shape\" DataType=\"System.String\" /> <Property Id=\"FontStyle\" DataType=\"System.Windows.FontStyle\" /> </Properties> </DirectedGraph> Which could be visualized like this: Notice also that properties can have labels, datatypes and descriptions. A \u201cHasCategory\u201d method is provided which will return true if the given category is found on the GraphObject or in anyway in the BasedOn chain. To define your own properties and categories see Schemas. Grouping A Graph can model the concept of grouping by using GraphLink to establish \u201cContains\u201d relationships between two nodes and a \u201cGroup\u201d property on the container node, like this: <Nodes> <Node Id=\"Child\" /> <Node Id=\"Group\" Group=\"Expanded\" /> </Nodes> <Links> <Link Source=\"Group\" Target=\"Child\" Category=\"Contains\" /> </Links> This describes a Graph that could be visualized like this: Nested containments can be described the same way and the Graph model provides helper methods for finding ancestors and descendants along these \u201cContains\u201d link relationships. The GraphModel also allows any number of links between nodes, so you could model multiple containment relationships and create a Graph that could be visualized like this: Note : Visual Studio does not support visualizing multi-containment. The Graph Model even allows a child to contain a parent and a parent to contain a child. This is called circular containment. This can be tricky to program, so the Graph Model provides helper methods for searching for ancestors and descendants without getting stuck in infinite loops caused by circularity. The Graph Model also provides a helper class called GraphGroup which wraps each GraphNode that has a Group property and exposes additional properties like ChildNodes and ChildGroups and Parents to make it even easier to deal with groups. But it is important to note that GraphGroup is a helper class and just a wrapper object on GraphNode. These objects are not constructed unless you ask for them and can come and go as the inner GraphNode is edited. For additional convenience you can also set properties and categories on the GraphGroup object and that will be passed down to the inner GraphNode object. So the GraphGroup always reflects the same categories and properties as the node that it wraps. The Graph object then also provides the following helper methods for dealing with groups: - AllGroups \u2013 returns a list of all GraphGroup objects - Groups \u2013 returns a list of top level groups - VisibleTopLevelGroups \u2013 returns a list of visible top level groups - FindCommonAncestor - return the common ancestor of all the given nodes - FindGroup \u2013 return the GraphGroup wrapper for a node that has a Group property - GetGroupDescendants \u2013 provides a way to walk the group hierarchy. MultiLinks The Graph model can also support multiple links between the same two nodes: These are known as multigraphs and are useful in modeling state machines where multiple different transitions can take you from one state to another. GraphLinks are distinguished from each other by providing a unique \u201cIndex\u201d property on each one using the following API: public GraphLink GetOrCreate(string sourceId, string targetId, int index) public GraphLink GetOrCreate(GraphNodeId sourceId, GraphNodeId targetId, int index) The index property that becomes part of the unique identifier of this link, so the unique identifier of a link is the source node id + target node id + index. So the index only needs to be unique between the same two nodes. If you specify an index that already exists then you will not be creating a new link, instead you will get back the existing link, which is the normal semantics for all Graph Model \u201cGetOrCreate\u201d methods. You can find the link with specific index using the following new overloads: public GraphLink Get(string sourceId, string targetId, int index) public GraphLink Get(GraphNodeId sourceId, GraphNodeId targetId, int index) And you can find out what index a given link has using the following property on GraphLink: public int Index { get; } This returns an optional Index of this link. Default is zero. This index can be specified when you create a link, providing different index values makes it possible to create multiple links between the same source and target nodes. The following graph is using multilinks where the \u201cReferences\u201d link has Index=1 and the \u201cCalls\u201d links has default index 0: And if you copy & paste that into the following graph, where this link has been manually edited to have Index=3: Then the link indexes will be preserved via serialization and you will get the following combined graph: The idea is that the \u201cIndex\u201d belongs to the end user, if they specify it, then they want it preserved. The GraphModel does not do any automatic re-writing of link indexes. Searching Graphs The following helper method makes navigating Graphs easier. public IEnumerable<GraphNode> FindRelatedNodes(GraphSearchDirection searchDirection, Predicate<GraphLink> traverseLink, Predicate<GraphNode> traverseNode, Predicate<GraphNode> acceptNode) This method finds the dgml nodes that match the acceptNode predicate and are related in a way that matches the traverseLink and traverseNode predicates. Nodes are found by doing a breadth first search along links matching the traverseLink predicate, in the Source or Target direction designated by the searchDirection parameter. If the node matches the traverseNode predicate it keeps searching recursively through that node in the same direction and returns all nodes that match the acceptNode predicate. The search can handle circularity in the graph. The following example searches through all nodes reachable via all links from the start node and returns all nodes that have the Method category: node.FindRelatedNodes(GraphSearchDirection.Target, l => true, n => true, n => HasCategory(MethodCategory); Eventing (Change Tracking) All changes to the graph model can be tracked using the following change events on the Graph object: public event EventHandler<GraphUpdatedEventArgs> Updated; public event EventHandler<GraphUpdatedEventArgs> Updating; The Updating method happens while a transaction is being committed so you can see the old property values before they are changed. The Updated event happens after a successful Commit happens and the GraphUpdatedEventArgs contains all the changes that happened within that transaction. You can listen to these events by doing the following: Graph g = new Graph(); g.Updated += OnGraphUpdated; It is highly recommended that you use GraphTransactionScope when you change multiple objects in the Graph like this: using (var scope = g.BeginUpdate(Guid.NewGuid(), \"Add stuff\", UndoOption.Add)) { GraphNode foo = g.Nodes.GetOrCreate(\"foo\"); GraphNode bar = g.Nodes.GetOrCreate(\"bar\"); GraphLink calls = g.Links.GetOrCreate(foo.Id, bar.Id, 0); GraphLink references = g.Links.GetOrCreate(foo.Id, bar.Id, 1); scope.Complete(); } Notice the important scope.Complete() call at the end of this block. See the section on Transactions below. When the transaction scope is completed, all these edits are rolled up into one batch operation so your OnGraphUpdated method will be given a GraphUpdatedEventArgs that contains the added nodes and added links: static void OnGraphUpdated(object sender, GraphUpdatedEventArgs e) { var nodes = e.AddedNodes; var links = e.AddedLinks; } This style of batching up updates results in much more efficient processing in an application because UI objects can respond to graph changes in batch updates, rather than being evented to death with too many fine grained singleton events. This style of batching also makes it trivial to implement Undo/Redo. Note : there is an important rule that you must obey in your OnGraphUpdated events. You must not create another GraphTransactionScope inside that event handler on the same Graph object. If you do attempt to do this you will get an invalid operation exception. If you really want fine grained events, you can also listen to the lower level PropertyChanged and CategoryChanged events on GraphObject. This is useful for UI Data Binding scenarios. Undo/Redo Support The following classes can be used to build an Undo/Redo stack for graph operations using the change tracking events GraphUndoUnit GraphUndoManager UndoableGraphTransactionScope UndoOptions Transactions As mentioned above in Eventing, it is highly recommended that you use GraphTransactionScope . In fact, if you don\u2019t use GraphTransactionScope then implicit scopes will be created for every individual edit, which can end up being a lot more expensive. GraphTransactionScopes support the following features: 1. If your code throws an exception before the scope.Complete call then all the changes inside that scope are rolled back, leaving the Graph in a consistent state. 2. Other threads are isolated from your changes until scope.Complete . This allows other threads to \u201cread\u201d the graph and see a consistent state until and your changes then appear atomically to them. ( Note : the Graph is not thread safe for Write operations. See Threading Model). 3. GraphTransactionScope supports nesting. For example your could call a method and that method creates another GraphTransactionScope and completes it before returning back to you. In this case the inner transaction is not really completed until the outer most GraphTransactionScope is completed. Similarly, if the inner scope is aborted, it is not aborted until the outer GraphTransactionScope is completed. Note: abort can be tricky, because an inner scope can cause all the outer scopes to be aborted. This can be a source of bugs. See Trouble Shooting. Threading Model The Graph object model is thread safe for \u201cread\u201d but not for \u201cwrite\u201d, there can only be one writer at a time. The GraphTransactionScopes provide thread isolated storage, so each reader sees a consistent view of the Graph model until each transaction is committed or rolled back. During commit however, the readers are not isolated while the changes stored in isolated storage are being merged back into the real storage. GraphNodeId, GraphCategory and GraphProperty are thread-safe for read and write. Graph Metadata The metadata associated with properties and categories is not stored directly in the GraphProperty or GraphCategory. Instead the metadata is stored in the Graph. In this way different instances of Graph could have different metadata associated with the same category or property. Conversly two Graphs could share the same metadata and reduce the overhead of copying all that redundant information. For example, one Graph might want the Background color of anything with the Plant category to be Green, while another Graph might want the Background color of anything with the same category to be Brown. This is possible, because the \u201cmetadata is local to the Graph\u201d and it is not statically shared. To enable this, the construction of GraphMetadata properties is done lazily via a \u201cFactory Pattern\u201d, where you provide the factory for the metdata when you register your property or category as follows: GraphCategory Vegetable = Schema.Categories.AddNewCategory(\"Vegetable\", () => { GraphMetadata meta = new GraphMetadata(GraphMetadataOptions.Default); meta.SetValue(Background, Brushes.Green); return meta; }); One other advantage of this lazy metadata model is that this metadata is only created when someone actually asks for it. The GraphMetadataOptions provide the following additional semantics associated with your property or category: Immutable - The property cannot be changed once set. Removable - The property can be removed after it is set. Otherwise it can only be changed, and not removed. Browsable - The property is visible in the UI (such as in tool tips and the property grid Serializable - The property will be serialized to DGML when the graph is serialized. Substitutable - File path values will be replaced with aliases during serialization. Sharable - The property will be transferred along with the GraphObject when the GraphObject is being copied to another graph. Sometimes it is useful to have private properties for you app state only that are not shared across copy/paste operations. Undoable - The property might not be serializble, but it needs to be saved on the undo stack and made undoable. Serializable is automatically also undoable, but you might also want properties that are not serializable but are undoable. The default set of metadata options is Serializable | Removable | Browsable | Sharable . Schemas Typically applications will want to define a set of related properties and categories, give that set a name and be able to reference the set that way. This is called a GraphSchema . A Graph can contain multiple different GraphSchemas. Typically GraphSchemas are defined statically and hooked into the common schema so they are discoverable from anywhere in the process, this ensures that properties are typed the same way throughout the process which is important. The following shows an example schema that defines a Background property of type Brush and a Vegetable category that has a default typed value of Green for the Background property. using Microsoft.VisualStudio.GraphModel.Schemas; public static class MySchema { static GraphSchema Schema; public static GraphCategory Vegetable; public static GraphProperty Background; static MySchema() { Schema = new GraphSchema(\"MySchema\"); GraphCommonSchema.Schema.AddSchema(Schema); Background = Schema.Properties.AddNewProperty(\"Background\", typeof(Brush)); Vegetable = Schema.Categories.AddNewCategory(\"Vegetable\", () => { GraphMetadata meta = new GraphMetadata( \"Vegetable\", \"This is a description of the category\", \"Living Things\", GraphMetadataOptions.Default); meta.SetValue(Background, Brushes.Green); return meta; }); } } You can then use your category like this: Graph g = new Graph(); g.Nodes.GetOrCreate(\"foo\", null, MySchema.Vegetable); g.Save(@\"d:\\temp\\graph.dgml\"); And the result will be serialized to the following DGML: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <DirectedGraph xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/vs/2009/dgml\"> <Nodes> <Node Id=\"foo\" Category=\"Vegetable\" /> </Nodes> <Links /> <Categories> <Category Id=\"Vegetable\" Background=\"#FF008000\" /> </Categories> <Properties> <Property Id=\"Background\" DataType=\"System.Windows.Media.Brush\" /> </Properties> </DirectedGraph> You can also fetch the metadata using the GetMetadata method on GraphProperty and GraphCategory : Graph g = new Graph(); var node = g.Nodes.GetOrCreate(\"foo\", null, MySchema.Vegetable); GraphCategory c = node.Categories.First(); GraphMetadata m = c.GetMetadata(g); Console.WriteLine(m.Description); This prints the message This is a description of the category . Notice that to get the metadata for a given category or property you need to provide the owing Graph object. GraphMetadata belongs to a graph instance, it is not static. This makes it easier to compose Graph objects in a large product like Visual Studio without without having to force every plugin to use a fixed common schema. Default Schema The following default schema is provided with every Graph by default. It defines categories and properties that are used by the Graph Model API itself and are common enough to be shared by all Graph instances. public static class GraphCommonSchema { public static GraphSchema Schema { get; } public static GraphProperty Visibility { get; } public static GraphProperty UniqueId { get; } public static GraphProperty TargetNode { get; } public static GraphProperty SourceNode { get; } public static GraphProperty Label { get; } public static GraphProperty IsTag { get; } public static GraphProperty IsPseudo { get; } public static GraphProperty IsContainment { get; } public static GraphProperty Group { get; } public static GraphProperty ValueLabel { get; } public static GraphCategory Contains { get; } public static GraphProperty GroupLabel { get; } public static GraphProperty Value { get; } public static GraphProperty TargetType { get; } public static GraphProperty Property { get; } public static GraphProperty Expression { get; } public static GraphProperty IsEnabled { get; } public static GraphProperty IsCursorContainingMethod { get; } public static GraphProperty IsDragSource { get; } public static GraphProperty DelayedCrossGroupLinksState { get; } public static GraphProperty DelayedChildNodesState { get; } public static GraphProperty BaseUri { get; } public static GraphProperty ToolTip { get; } public static GraphProperty Version { get; } } Styles The GraphModel provides a way to define GraphProperty values in a \u201cconditional\u201d way based on conditional expressions stored in Conditional Styles. While the name \u201cStyle\u201d has user interface connotations, this is not the only reason to use styles. You could also think of Styles as a system for generating \u201cComputed Property Values\u201d. You\u2019ll see the following classes in the Microsoft.VisualStudio.GraphModel.Styles namespace: Conditional styles look similar to WPF styles, but the expressions can be more powerful. The following is a conditional style serialized as DGML. <Style TargetType=\"Node\" GroupLabel=\"Class\" ValueLabel=\"Has category\"> <Condition Expression=\"HasCategory('Class')\" /> <Setter Property=\"Background\" Value=\"#D3DCEF\" /> <Setter Property=\"Icon\" Value=\"CodeSchema_Class\" /> </Style> This style defines a Background and Icon property value for all nodes that have the \u201cClass\u201d category. The side effect of having this style associated with the Graph object is that any time you call GetValue on a node that also has any category based on the \u201cClass\u201d category, you will get back the Background property value defined above. GraphNode foo = g.Nodes.GetOrCreate(\"foo\", null, MySchema.Class); Brush brush = foo.GetValue<Brush>(MySchema.Background); This example is the same as storing the Background property on the GraphCategory metadata, however the conditional style expression can be a lot richer. For example, the following expression will cause the style to be applied only if the class is public and has more than 10 outgoing links. <Condition Expression=\"IsPublic and OutgoingLinkCount > 10\" /> The property setters can also provide expressions instead of fixed values, so that you can have computed values. The following example shows how you can combine these ideas to produce interesting results: <Style TargetType=\"Node\" GroupLabel=\"Coverage\" ValueLabel=\"Good\"> <Condition Expression=\"Coverage &gt; 80\" /> <Setter Property=\"Background\" Value=\"Green\" /> </Style> <Style TargetType=\"Node\" GroupLabel=\"Coverage\" ValueLabel=\"Ok\"> <Condition Expression=\"Coverage &gt; 50\" /> <Setter Property=\"Background\" Expression=\"Color.FromRgb(180 * Math.Max(1, (80 - Coverage) / 30), 180, 0)\" /> </Style> <Style TargetType=\"Node\" GroupLabel=\"Coverage\" ValueLabel=\"Bad\"> <Setter Property=\"Background\" Expression=\"Color.FromRgb(180, 180 * Coverage / 50, 0)\" /> </Style> This set of styles breaks the nodes into groups. The first group has \u201cCoverage\u201d property > 80, the next has Coverage > 50, and the last one has all the others. Then a Background color property is computed based on the Coverage property values so that the result is a gradation of colors between green and red that illustrate the amount of Coverage that each node has: This shows that Styles are applied in a given order (they order in which they are added to the ConditionalStyleCollection ), and the style that matches first owns the properties it is setting. In other words, the following Styles that also match, will only be able to affect different properties on the nodes. Another way to say it is that the properties affected by matching styles are mututally exlusive. Styles can have a TargetType of Node, Link or Group. Style Compilation & Evaluation Styles will not automatically be applied to your Graph unless you Compile the style set using the Compile method on the GraphConditionalStyleCollection . Style Eventing Your application may want to receive PropertyChange events on nodes and links whenever the style is changed, or the property values on which they are conditionally evaluated change. For example, in the above example if I change the \u201cCoverage\u201d property from 50 to 80, then I expect the \u201cBackground\u201d property value to change in the user interface. But how does this work? A Graph \u201cUpdated\u201d event will not be fired automatically in this case and the GraphNode PropertyChange event will not be fired automatically when you set the Coverage property. Once you Compile your GraphConditionalStyleCollection , it will then start tracking changes to properties in the Graph and it will remember if it sees any property change that has a conditional expression or setter expression that references that property. Then at the time you want your user interface updated you must call the RaisePendingPropertyChangeEvents passing in the nodes you want updated. You might limit it to just the visible nodes in your user interface for example. This will then raise OnPropertyChange events for all the affected style setters, in this case the \u201cBackground\u201d properties change events are raised and it raises it only on graph objects that match the conditional expressions. See Data Binding for more information. Psuedo Nodes and Links Sometimes it is handy to generate fake nodes and links in your Graph object that you do not want serialized back to disk. In this case you can add the IsPseudo property to them and when you save the Graph they will disappear: GraphNode fake = g.Nodes.GetOrCreate(\"fake\"); fake.IsPseudo = true; Serialization The Graph model can serialize itself to and from the DGML XML format. The easiest way to serialize a graph is using the Load and Save methods: Graph graph = Graph.Load(dgmlFile); graph.Save(@\"d:\\temp\\graph.dgml\"); That is pretty much all you will ever need to know. There is a GraphSerializationSettings class that allows you to control sorting and do some error handling. You can also use it to re-write the GraphNodeIds during serialization which can be handy way to transform names. GraphDataObject Related to the topic of serialization is the GraphDataObject helper class which implements the WPF IDataObject interface and provides a way to exchange graph objects in copy/paste and/or drag/drop operations. In order to make this possible the Graph object itself is also ISerializable . It\u2019s implementation just uses it\u2019s built in DGML serialization abilities. When you create a GraphDataObject you can decide which clipboard formats you want it to publish using this method: public static IDataObject Create(IEnumerable<GraphNode> selection, Guid sourceGraphId, int levels, DataFormat[] formats) Or you can use the other method and get the default set AllDgmlFormats which include DGML, XML, Text and UnicodeText. The Text format is DGML, so some applications like to publish only DGML and XML and switch the Text format to something more readable. The GraphDataObject also provides helper methods for efficiently sniffing the clipboard to see if it contains something like valid DGML: public static bool IsClipboardDgml() and public static bool IsDgml(string markup) Merging Drag/Drop If you bring subsets of a Graph across in multiple drag/drop operations, you will probably want the \u201clinks\u201d to hook up. For example, suppose you have this graph: Now suppose you grab the \u201cFoo\u201d node and drag it or copy/paste it to a new graph. You will want this: Now go back to the original graph and bring over the comment. You will probably expect to see this: For this to work the GraphDataObject needs to contain more than just the selected nodes. Usually, you call GraphDataObject.Create with the selection, and pass the \u201clevels\u201d parameter value 1 so that it includes all nodes 1 link away from the selection. Then on the drop/paste side you want to \u201cMerge\u201d that GraphDataObject into your target Graph object, and delete the extra information that was not needed. For example, in the first drop operation you do not want the comment or the link. In the second drop operation you do want the link but you don\u2019t need Foo because you already have it, so you want it merged. To enable all this, the GraphDataObject.Create method does the following: 1. It marks the selected nodes with an GraphCommonSchema.IsDragSource property. 2. It marks all nodes that are not in the selection with : SetValue(GraphCommonSchema.Visibility, System.Windows.Visibility.Hidden) Then on the Merge side you can: 1. Make sure not to override Visibility on the target nodes 2. Do not create nodes or links if the dropped node is hidden and the target nodes didn\u2019t already exist 3. Select all nodes with IsDragSource property, then remove this temporary property. In this way you can get the above semantics in your application. Advanced Serialization You are welcome to read about advanced compression techniques below, but few people will need to know about this because the Graph Load and Save methods hide all this gory detail from you. If you look at a serialized DGML file, however, you may notice some of these things and wonder how they work. File Path Substitution You might have many repetitions of a long file path in your node ids or in property values. For example, a graph of mscorlib could contain thousands of copies of the string file:///C:/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/mscorlib.dll . In this case it is possible to tell the Graph to give this path a name, let\u2019s call it \u201cFxUri\u201d and then everywhere this path is found it can write out the variable substitution instead which is much shorter: $(FxUri)/mscorlib.dll These path names are defined in the GraphPathSerializationDictionary which is available from the CommonPaths property on the Graph object. This property is static so you can define the common paths before you call Graph.Load. This makes it possible to also map these common paths to different locations on your machine, which can help to make DGML documents more \u201cportable\u201d. The Graph serializer sets up a bunch of common paths by default, basically all the Environment.GetSpecialFolders plus .NET frameworks, reference assemblies and your current directory. Your application can listen to the CommonPathsAdded event on the GraphPathSerializationDictionary to add any more paths that are not predefined that way. GraphNodeId aliasing GraphNodeIds can also contain many redundant sub-parts, as shown in the top section on GraphNodeId. Serializing all this back out can result in lots of redundant text. So the Graph serializer creates integer values for each unique GraphNodeId called \u201caliases\u201d and uses those instead of the long serialized text. Then it writes the aliases to disk in a special section of the DGML file as follows: <IdentifierAliases> <Alias n=\"1\" Uri=\"Assembly=$(fxUri)/mscorlib.dll\" /> <Alias n=\"2\" Id=\"Namespace=System\" /> <Alias n=\"3\" Id=\"(@1 @2)\" /> <Alias n=\"4\" Id=\"(@1 @2 Type=String)\" /> <Alias n=\"6\" Id=\"(@1 @2 Type= String Member=Join)\" /> </IdentifierAliases> Then the ids in the nodes and links can be very small like this: <Link Source=\"@3\" Target=\"@4\" Category=\"Contains\" /> <Link Source=\"@3\" Target=\"@5\" Category=\"Contains\" /> <Link Source=\"@4\" Target=\"@6\" Category=\"Contains\" /> <Link Source=\"@4\" Target=\"@7\" Category=\"IndirectlyContains\" /> <Link Source=\"@6\" Target=\"@7\" Category=\"Contains\"> Notice that the aliases can use the path substition as well. Note: you will never see path variables or aliases in memory after you do Graph.Load. Linq Extensions GraphEnumerable provides the following extension methods: - AsNodes \u2013 this method makes it easier to deal with heterogeneous collections of GraphNode and GraphGroup by unwrapping the GraphGroup objects, returning only GraphNodes. - GetGroups \u2013 this method returns only GraphGroup objects stripping out any objects that are not groups. - GetDescendants \u2013 this method returns all descendants of the given graph objects, independent of whether those objects are GraphNodes or GraphGroups. Data Binding In order to support dynamic languages and WPF data binding the GraphObject implements the following interfaces: IDynamicMetaObjectProvider INotifyPropertyChanged GraphNodeIdPropertyDescriptor The dynamic meta object provides BindGetMember and BindSetMember as a way to set properties on the graph. This makes it possible to interact with GraphProperties using dynamics like this: dynamic node = g.Nodes.GetOrCreate(\"Foo\"); node.Color = Colors.Red; This combined with INotifyPropertyChanged allows WPF to you to bind to the properties stored in a GraphObject to a visual element and WPF will know how to watch for property change events on those properties. The GraphNodeIdPropertyDescriptor is a specialized class that makes it possible to present a GraphNodeId in a property window in a structured way like this: Graph Providers Some interfaces are defined for those who want to create a plugin model that provides Graph subsets to other parts of the application. This is used in Visual Studio - it is how languages extend Solution Explorer with type information. Graph generators like to share common concepts in the form of graph schemas containing common GraphNodeIdNames, GraphCategories and GraphProperites. These shared classes are described in GraphProvider.docx spec. Data Virtualization Sometimes you might want a graph that represents only a portion of what is available in a data base. In this case it is handy to remember which groups are fully populated and which are not. The following GraphProperties helps with this: DelayedChildNodesState DelayedCrossGroupLinksState IsDelayedCrossGroupLink DelayedDataState No actual support for Data Virtualization is provided beyond just this convention for annotating where you are doing Data Virtualization in your Graph objects. This could help for example, in creating visuals that know how to represent this concept in a user interface, independent of the implementation behind it. Trouble Shooting One common source of bugs is when someone forgets to include a scope.Complete() at the end of their GraphTransactionScope using block. This will cause the transaction to roll back, along with any outer GraphTransactionScopes, and it will look like the graph edits didn\u2019t work, when in reality, they are being rolled back.","title":"GraphModel Specification"},{"location":"posts/GraphModel/#dgml-graph-model-specifications","text":"The Directed Graph Markup Language (.dgml) features of Visual Studio are built on a node/link graph data model.

To this end the Graph Model does not use System.String to name things. The GraphNodeId class is used instead. GraphNodeId is a structured identifier that composes nested sets of Name=Value pairs, for example, you can create a GraphNodeId that points to an Assembly like this: GraphNodeId mscorlib = GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.AssemblyName, new Uri(typeof(string).Assembly.Location)); This serializes to the following string format: (Assembly=file:///C:/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/mscorlib.dll) Then you can name the System Namespace inside mscorlib by composing the following two names together: GraphNodeId system = mscorlib + GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.NamespaceName, \"System\"); Then you can name the String Class by adding on to the name of the namespace: GraphNodeId str = system + GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.TypeName, \"String\"); Then you can name the Join method by adding to the name of the class: GraphNodeId join = str + GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.Name, \"Join\"); The result is an identifier that remembers the structure you used to build the name and this structure can also be serialized to and from the following string format: (Assembly=file:///C:/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/mscorlib.dll Namespace=System Class=String Method=Join) This sort of composition of names allows the application to avoid having to do lots of expensive string parsing operations every time it needs a part of the name. It also provides hashing advantages so that comparing identifiers is a lot faster and the overall memory used is much less than using strings. As you can imagine, naming everything in mscorlib results in many redundant Assembly, Namespace, Class sub strings, so building up identifiers using string addition would be very expensive: string mscorlib = \u201cAssembly=file:///C:/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/mscorlib.dll\u201d; string system = mscorlib + \u201c Namespace=System\u201d; string stringClass = system + \u201c Type=String\u201d; string joinMethod = stringClass + \u201cMethod=Join\u201d; The following table shows the comparison between System.String and GraphNodeId in construction time, comparison and total memory usage measured using all the identifiers in System.Xml.Linq.dll (about 2000 identifiers) and about 4 million comparisons (comparing every identifier against every other). The construction time for the GraphNodeId\u2019s here is the worst case and assumes no reuse of in memory ids. For example, it recreates the Assembly id over and over rather than holding onto one GraphNodeId pointer for that assembly. This is not typically how the product code will work, but it is the worst case. It is how Serialization would work, so it essentially measures serialization load time. For that reason strings are faster to load, but you can see that memory usage and comparison time, GraphNodeId wins considerably, this is because GraphNodeId is \u201catomized\u201d, so that comparison can be a simple object reference comparison. Note: string.Intern doesn\u2019t help the string case here because every identifier is different, and string.Intern would add substantial hit to load time, which would make it slower than GraphNodeId. GraphNodeId registration is static so they employ a WeakReference system to garbage collect ids that are not used.","title":"GraphNodeId"},{"location":"posts/GraphModel/#graphnodeid-value-types","text":"The GraphNodeId values can be any type that can be converted to/from a string using TypeConverter.

The name also determines the type of value that the GraphNodeId can contain, and how a string should be parsed back during string serialization.

There are also 3 special names for qualified identifiers. These are non-printed names, and are inferred during parsing. GraphNodeIdName.Nested \u2013 a list of GraphNodeIds \u201c(Assembly=file://mscorlib.dll Namespace=System Type=String)\u201d. The data type of a Nested value is always GraphNodeIdCollection. In the above case, there are 3 nested identifiers: Assembly, Namespace and Type. GraphNodeIdName.Array \u2013 represents a list of GraphNodeId\u2019s where each item in the list has the same type. For example, the arguments to a method each have the same type \u201cMethodParameter\u201d, so think of the array as a way to lift the \u201cMethodParameter\u201d part out of the list, so instead of (MethodParameter=Value MethodParameter=Value MethodParameter=Value) you can say MethodParameter=[Value, Value, Value]. The data type of Array value is always GraphNodeIdCollection \u2013 with homogeneousItems =true. GraphNodeIdName.Literal - \u201cBing!\u201d. The data type of a Literal is a String. If a GraphNodeId is being constructed through parsing, and a name is not currently registered, a new name will be registered with a data type of System.Object.

The fact that the generic parameter is called T does not need to be remembered here: GraphNodeId iequatableGeneric = GraphNodeId.GetNested(new GraphNodeId[] {iequatable, GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.GenericParameterCountName, 1) }); Now we can say TypeName=IEquatable<T> like this: GraphNodeId typeName = GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.TypeName, iequatableGeneric); Now we can describe the method parameters using this nested name: GraphNodeId methodParameters = GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.OverloadingParametersName, new GraphNodeIdCollection(true, GraphNodeId.GetNested(new GraphNodeId[] { mscorlib, system, typeName }))); Now we can describe the \u201cEquals\u201d method and it\u2019s parameters using this: GraphNodeId method = GraphNodeId.GetPartial(CodeNames.MemberName, GraphNodeId.GetNested(new GraphNodeId[] { equals, methodParameters })); Now we can fully type the method by adding assembly, namespace and type GraphNodeId result = GraphNodeId.GetNested(new GraphNodeId[] { mscorlib, system, typeName, method }); This results in the following serialized identifier: (Assembly=\"file://c:/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/mscorlib.dll\" Namespace=System Type=(Name=IEquatable GenericParameterCount=1) Member=(Name=Equals OverloadingParameters=[(Assembly = \"file://c:/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/mscorlib.dll\" Namespace = System Type = (Name = IEquatable GenericParameterCount = 1))]))} Notice how in the construction of the GraphNodeId that many sub-parts can be shared across many GraphNodeIds and this is how it can achieve performance and memory wins.","title":"Nesting"},{"location":"posts/GraphModel/#core-model","text":"The core graph model begins with the container called Graph.

In this way the Graph is always left in a valid state after any editing operation. Graph nodes and links cannot belong to multiple Graph objects at the same time. If you add a node to a different Graph than it was created in, then that will become an \u201cimport\u201d operation and a new GraphNode instance will be created.

For example, we can promote the Backgound and FontStyle properties to the GraphCategory and thereby every node that has the Category=\u201dVegetable\u201d will be italic and every node with the Category=\u201dElement\u201d will be blue. <Category Id=\"Element\" Background=\"Blue\" /> <Category Id=\"Plant\" FontStyle=\"Italic\" /> Now anything with the category Plant will have a tree icon, including anything that has the category Tree, since the Tree category is \u201cBasedOn\u201d the Plant category. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <DirectedGraph GraphDirection=\"LeftToRight\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/vs/2009/dgml\"> <Nodes> <Node Id=\"A\" Category=\"Tree\" Label=\"Tree\" /> <Node Id=\"B\" Category=\"Element\" Label=\"Water\" /> </Nodes> <Links> <Link Source=\"A\" Target=\"B\" /> </Links> <Categories> <Category Id=\"Element\" Background=\"#FF0000FF\" /> <Category Id=\"Plant\" FontStyle=\"Italic\" /> <Category Id=\"Tree\" Icon=\"Tree.png\" BasedOn=\"Plant\" Shape=\"None\" /> </Categories> <Properties> <Property Id=\"Background\" Label=\"Background\" Description=\"The background color\" DataType=\"System.Windows.Media.Brush\" /> <Property Id=\"GraphDirection\" DataType=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Diagrams.Layout.LayoutOrientation\" /> <Property Id=\"Icon\" Label=\"Icon\" Description=\"Icon\" DataType=\"System.String\" /> <Property Id=\"Shape\" DataType=\"System.String\" /> <Property Id=\"FontStyle\" DataType=\"System.Windows.FontStyle\" /> </Properties> </DirectedGraph> Which could be visualized like this: Notice also that properties can have labels, datatypes and descriptions.

The GraphModel also allows any number of links between nodes, so you could model multiple containment relationships and create a Graph that could be visualized like this: Note : Visual Studio does not support visualizing multi-containment. The Graph Model even allows a child to contain a parent and a parent to contain a child. This is called circular containment. This can be tricky to program, so the Graph Model provides helper methods for searching for ancestors and descendants without getting stuck in infinite loops caused by circularity. The Graph Model also provides a helper class called GraphGroup which wraps each GraphNode that has a Group property and exposes additional properties like ChildNodes and ChildGroups and Parents to make it even easier to deal with groups. But it is important to note that GraphGroup is a helper class and just a wrapper object on GraphNode. These objects are not constructed unless you ask for them and can come and go as the inner GraphNode is edited. For additional convenience you can also set properties and categories on the GraphGroup object and that will be passed down to the inner GraphNode object. So the GraphGroup always reflects the same categories and properties as the node that it wraps. The Graph object then also provides the following helper methods for dealing with groups: - AllGroups \u2013 returns a list of all GraphGroup objects - Groups \u2013 returns a list of top level groups - VisibleTopLevelGroups \u2013 returns a list of visible top level groups - FindCommonAncestor - return the common ancestor of all the given nodes - FindGroup \u2013 return the GraphGroup wrapper for a node that has a Group property - GetGroupDescendants \u2013 provides a way to walk the group hierarchy.","title":"Grouping"},{"location":"posts/GraphModel/#multilinks","text":"The Graph model can also support multiple links between the same two nodes: These are known as multigraphs and are useful in modeling state machines where multiple different transitions can take you from one state to another. GraphLinks are distinguished from each other by providing a unique \u201cIndex\u201d property on each one using the following API: public GraphLink GetOrCreate(string sourceId, string targetId, int index) public GraphLink GetOrCreate(GraphNodeId sourceId, GraphNodeId targetId, int index) The index property that becomes part of the unique identifier of this link, so the unique identifier of a link is the source node id + target node id + index. So the index only needs to be unique between the same two nodes. If you specify an index that already exists then you will not be creating a new link, instead you will get back the existing link, which is the normal semantics for all Graph Model \u201cGetOrCreate\u201d methods. You can find the link with specific index using the following new overloads: public GraphLink Get(string sourceId, string targetId, int index) public GraphLink Get(GraphNodeId sourceId, GraphNodeId targetId, int index) And you can find out what index a given link has using the following property on GraphLink: public int Index { get; } This returns an optional Index of this link. Default is zero. This index can be specified when you create a link, providing different index values makes it possible to create multiple links between the same source and target nodes. The following graph is using multilinks where the \u201cReferences\u201d link has Index=1 and the \u201cCalls\u201d links has default index 0: And if you copy & paste that into the following graph, where this link has been manually edited to have Index=3: Then the link indexes will be preserved via serialization and you will get the following combined graph: The idea is that the \u201cIndex\u201d belongs to the end user, if they specify it, then they want it preserved.

Nodes are found by doing a breadth first search along links matching the traverseLink predicate, in the Source or Target direction designated by the searchDirection parameter. If the node matches the traverseNode predicate it keeps searching recursively through that node in the same direction and returns all nodes that match the acceptNode predicate. The search can handle circularity in the graph.

The Updated event happens after a successful Commit happens and the GraphUpdatedEventArgs contains all the changes that happened within that transaction. You can listen to these events by doing the following: Graph g = new Graph(); g.Updated += OnGraphUpdated; It is highly recommended that you use GraphTransactionScope when you change multiple objects in the Graph like this: using (var scope = g.BeginUpdate(Guid.NewGuid(), \"Add stuff\", UndoOption.Add)) { GraphNode foo = g.Nodes.GetOrCreate(\"foo\"); GraphNode bar = g.Nodes.GetOrCreate(\"bar\"); GraphLink calls = g.Links.GetOrCreate(foo.Id, bar.Id, 0); GraphLink references = g.Links.GetOrCreate(foo.Id, bar.Id, 1); scope.Complete(); } Notice the important scope.Complete() call at the end of this block. See the section on Transactions below. When the transaction scope is completed, all these edits are rolled up into one batch operation so your OnGraphUpdated method will be given a GraphUpdatedEventArgs that contains the added nodes and added links: static void OnGraphUpdated(object sender, GraphUpdatedEventArgs e) { var nodes = e.AddedNodes; var links = e.AddedLinks; } This style of batching up updates results in much more efficient processing in an application because UI objects can respond to graph changes in batch updates, rather than being evented to death with too many fine grained singleton events. This style of batching also makes it trivial to implement Undo/Redo. Note : there is an important rule that you must obey in your OnGraphUpdated events. You must not create another GraphTransactionScope inside that event handler on the same Graph object. If you do attempt to do this you will get an invalid operation exception.

If your code throws an exception before the scope.Complete call then all the changes inside that scope are rolled back, leaving the Graph in a consistent state. 2.

In this case the inner transaction is not really completed until the outer most GraphTransactionScope is completed.

Instead the metadata is stored in the Graph. In this way different instances of Graph could have different metadata associated with the same category or property. Conversly two Graphs could share the same metadata and reduce the overhead of copying all that redundant information. For example, one Graph might want the Background color of anything with the Plant category to be Green, while another Graph might want the Background color of anything with the same category to be Brown. This is possible, because the \u201cmetadata is local to the Graph\u201d and it is not statically shared. To enable this, the construction of GraphMetadata properties is done lazily via a \u201cFactory Pattern\u201d, where you provide the factory for the metdata when you register your property or category as follows: GraphCategory Vegetable = Schema.Categories.AddNewCategory(\"Vegetable\", () => { GraphMetadata meta = new GraphMetadata(GraphMetadataOptions.Default); meta.SetValue(Background, Brushes.Green); return meta; }); One other advantage of this lazy metadata model is that this metadata is only created when someone actually asks for it. The GraphMetadataOptions provide the following additional semantics associated with your property or category: Immutable - The property cannot be changed once set. Removable - The property can be removed after it is set. Otherwise it can only be changed, and not removed. Browsable - The property is visible in the UI (such as in tool tips and the property grid Serializable - The property will be serialized to DGML when the graph is serialized. Substitutable - File path values will be replaced with aliases during serialization. Sharable - The property will be transferred along with the GraphObject when the GraphObject is being copied to another graph. Sometimes it is useful to have private properties for you app state only that are not shared across copy/paste operations. Undoable - The property might not be serializble, but it needs to be saved on the undo stack and made undoable.

This is called a GraphSchema . A Graph can contain multiple different GraphSchemas. Typically GraphSchemas are defined statically and hooked into the common schema so they are discoverable from anywhere in the process, this ensures that properties are typed the same way throughout the process which is important. The following shows an example schema that defines a Background property of type Brush and a Vegetable category that has a default typed value of Green for the Background property. using Microsoft.VisualStudio.GraphModel.Schemas; public static class MySchema { static GraphSchema Schema; public static GraphCategory Vegetable; public static GraphProperty Background; static MySchema() { Schema = new GraphSchema(\"MySchema\"); GraphCommonSchema.Schema.AddSchema(Schema); Background = Schema.Properties.AddNewProperty(\"Background\", typeof(Brush)); Vegetable = Schema.Categories.AddNewCategory(\"Vegetable\", () => { GraphMetadata meta = new GraphMetadata( \"Vegetable\", \"This is a description of the category\", \"Living Things\", GraphMetadataOptions.Default); meta.SetValue(Background, Brushes.Green); return meta; }); } } You can then use your category like this: Graph g = new Graph(); g.Nodes.GetOrCreate(\"foo\", null, MySchema.Vegetable); g.Save(@\"d:\\temp\\graph.dgml\"); And the result will be serialized to the following DGML: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <DirectedGraph xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/vs/2009/dgml\"> <Nodes> <Node Id=\"foo\" Category=\"Vegetable\" /> </Nodes> <Links /> <Categories> <Category Id=\"Vegetable\" Background=\"#FF008000\" /> </Categories> <Properties> <Property Id=\"Background\" DataType=\"System.Windows.Media.Brush\" /> </Properties> </DirectedGraph> You can also fetch the metadata using the GetMetadata method on GraphProperty and GraphCategory : Graph g = new Graph(); var node = g.Nodes.GetOrCreate(\"foo\", null, MySchema.Vegetable); GraphCategory c = node.Categories.First(); GraphMetadata m = c.GetMetadata(g); Console.WriteLine(m.Description); This prints the message This is a description of the category . Notice that to get the metadata for a given category or property you need to provide the owing Graph object. GraphMetadata belongs to a graph instance, it is not static.

While the name \u201cStyle\u201d has user interface connotations, this is not the only reason to use styles. You could also think of Styles as a system for generating \u201cComputed Property Values\u201d. You\u2019ll see the following classes in the Microsoft.VisualStudio.GraphModel.Styles namespace: Conditional styles look similar to WPF styles, but the expressions can be more powerful. The following is a conditional style serialized as DGML. <Style TargetType=\"Node\" GroupLabel=\"Class\" ValueLabel=\"Has category\"> <Condition Expression=\"HasCategory('Class')\" /> <Setter Property=\"Background\" Value=\"#D3DCEF\" /> <Setter Property=\"Icon\" Value=\"CodeSchema_Class\" /> </Style> This style defines a Background and Icon property value for all nodes that have the \u201cClass\u201d category. The side effect of having this style associated with the Graph object is that any time you call GetValue on a node that also has any category based on the \u201cClass\u201d category, you will get back the Background property value defined above. GraphNode foo = g.Nodes.GetOrCreate(\"foo\", null, MySchema.Class); Brush brush = foo.GetValue<Brush>(MySchema.Background); This example is the same as storing the Background property on the GraphCategory metadata, however the conditional style expression can be a lot richer. For example, the following expression will cause the style to be applied only if the class is public and has more than 10 outgoing links. <Condition Expression=\"IsPublic and OutgoingLinkCount > 10\" /> The property setters can also provide expressions instead of fixed values, so that you can have computed values. The following example shows how you can combine these ideas to produce interesting results: <Style TargetType=\"Node\" GroupLabel=\"Coverage\" ValueLabel=\"Good\"> <Condition Expression=\"Coverage &gt; 80\" /> <Setter Property=\"Background\" Value=\"Green\" /> </Style> <Style TargetType=\"Node\" GroupLabel=\"Coverage\" ValueLabel=\"Ok\"> <Condition Expression=\"Coverage &gt; 50\" /> <Setter Property=\"Background\" Expression=\"Color.FromRgb(180 * Math.Max(1, (80 - Coverage) / 30), 180, 0)\" /> </Style> <Style TargetType=\"Node\" GroupLabel=\"Coverage\" ValueLabel=\"Bad\"> <Setter Property=\"Background\" Expression=\"Color.FromRgb(180, 180 * Coverage / 50, 0)\" /> </Style> This set of styles breaks the nodes into groups. The first group has \u201cCoverage\u201d property > 80, the next has Coverage > 50, and the last one has all the others. Then a Background color property is computed based on the Coverage property values so that the result is a gradation of colors between green and red that illustrate the amount of Coverage that each node has: This shows that Styles are applied in a given order (they order in which they are added to the ConditionalStyleCollection ), and the style that matches first owns the properties it is setting. In other words, the following Styles that also match, will only be able to affect different properties on the nodes. Another way to say it is that the properties affected by matching styles are mututally exlusive. Styles can have a TargetType of Node, Link or Group.","title":"Styles"},{"location":"posts/GraphModel/#style-compilation-evaluation","text":"Styles will not automatically be applied to your Graph unless you Compile the style set using the Compile method on the GraphConditionalStyleCollection .","title":"Style Compilation &amp; Evaluation"},{"location":"posts/GraphModel/#style-eventing","text":"Your application may want to receive PropertyChange events on nodes and links whenever the style is changed, or the property values on which they are conditionally evaluated change.

But how does this work? A Graph \u201cUpdated\u201d event will not be fired automatically in this case and the GraphNode PropertyChange event will not be fired automatically when you set the Coverage property. Once you Compile your GraphConditionalStyleCollection , it will then start tracking changes to properties in the Graph and it will remember if it sees any property change that has a conditional expression or setter expression that references that property. Then at the time you want your user interface updated you must call the RaisePendingPropertyChangeEvents passing in the nodes you want updated. You might limit it to just the visible nodes in your user interface for example.

The software brings together a bunch of interesting parts\u2026 AI cameras recognize facial expressions , the predictions go to the Azure cloud, from there a server in building 99 orchestrates the lighting design which includes all the LEDs inside Ada and some big DMX par lights to add more dramatic effects. The Server sends the information to 3 raspberry pi devices which forward it on to 3 Teensy 4.0 devices which drive the long LED strips with very precise microsecond timing. The whole thing is powered through 2 Kasa HS105 switches so the Server can put Ada to sleep every night. These switches connect to a little Raspberry Pi Zero that is running a private wifi network just for them and the pi zero communicates with the server.

I had lots of fun hooking it up to Azure ML so we could run an end-to-end model search optimizing the models found so they run well on Qualcomm 888 chipsets, specifically the DSP processor which runs a quantized version of the model. One fun example is a image segmentation model trained on a synthetic dataset : These models can detect 19 categories of pixel including the background, skin, eyes, ears, nose, lips, clothing, hair, beard, and so on all in about 2 milliseconds on the Qualcomm DSP chip which is simply amazing to me. First you define a search space starting with a baseline model architecture, then tell it to go! We ran this in Azure using the Evolutionary Pareto Search algorithm and it was fun to watch the models appear, steadly improving the pareto curve: This resulting models have an inference time that span 2.5ms all the way up to 15ms. When finished we do full training on the final best models on the pareto frontier which gave us the following. This chart is showing a nice jump up in the validation accuracies (measured as intersection over union (IOU) score) resulting from full training. The Archai search uses only partial training with only 1 epoch in order to save on training costs. For the search algorithm to find the best models it only needs relative comparison on model accuracies and 1 epoch is enough to get those relative differences. Now we have some fully trained models we can test these models on the Qualcomm devices to measure the F1 scores: Here the F1 score almost reaches 92% and the really fast models that are down under 2ms are still above 84% accuracy. This is super cool. You can then pick a model from this pareto curve that satisfies your constraints. For example, some applications may have strict accuracy requirement, some have a strict latency budget and power usage goal. For example, if your inference time budget requires the model run in under 4ms then you will need to pick a model on the left of that time. On the other hand if accuracy is all that matters you would pick the biggest slowest model on the right. This is why Archai produces models on the entire pareto frontier. There is no one best model, it depends on your application. To read about the full workflow and how we made all this happen in Azure ML see the readme The whole thing cost about $1000 in Azure training time, which may seem expensive, but that\u2019s only a few hours for an \u201cAI Whisperer\u201d which is a red hot job market right now. Besides if your model is going into production and was taking 10ms before Archai search and is now taking 2ms, that 5 times speedup will come back in inference dollars saved, or real customer satisfaction in terms of greatly reduced battery usage on a phone, both are well worth the investment in Neural Architecture Search.","title":"Find better models!"},{"location":"posts/archai/#archai-can-find-better-models","text":"So I\u2019ve been working on this cool framework called Archai which can automate the process of finding better Neural Network model architectures.

To turn off neighborhood select the \u201cOff\u201d command inside the drop down menu next to the icon on the toolbar. Neighborhood mode can help when you have messy graphs like this one: In this case if you only care about one degree of freedom from the selected node then neighborhood mode will give you this nice clean subset: Butterfly mode On the Directed Graph Document toolbar this command removes cycles in the graph so that you see only the tree if incoming and outgoing dependencies around the selected node. This works nicely together with neighborhood mode. To recompute the butterfly simply click the toolbar button again after moving the selection. If you add butterfly mode to the above neighborhood example you get this even cleaner graph: Notice the difference between the two graphs is that butterfly mode removed the cycles so you can see a clean picture of incoming and outgoing dependencies relative to the selected node. Butterly also ensures that the arrows flow in the same direction which makes seeing the dependencies a lot easier. Just note that in removing cycles there may be some missing circular dependencies which you won\u2019t discover until you move the center of the butterfly. Windows Drag/Drop Simply drag images from Windows Explorer onto the canvas so you can wire them up with links and groups and quickly create some really nice looking diagrams.

While Visual Studio provides excellent support for viewing and editing DGML graphs, it is sometimes necessary to provide DGML graphs over the Web in HTML pages as static images so that the value of DGML visualizations can be shared with the entire world. An excellent example of this is the Reference Conflicts Analyzer by J\u00f3zsef Kanczler. In this example, you have a build server that runs code analysis tools, those tools provide insights as DGML diagrams, and so then it is natural to want to visualize those results on a website for anyone to see \u2013 even folks who don\u2019t have Visual Studio handy.

He works for FIRST and the problem is figuring out how to match up over 400 teams in Washington State with 5 separate event locations, minimizing the driving distance for each of those teams. Each event was happening on the same day, and each team gets to compete at only one of these events. So I quickly cranked out a nice little Silverlight Application to do the job. And I hooked up to the BING Mapping API to calculate the actual driving distances from each team to each event location. Silverlight and BING worked beautifully together. So far so good, but now for the hard part. How do you calculate the optimal assignment of teams to events that results in minimal total driving distance? I hacked out a brute force solution that first assigned every team to their closest venue, but then there were additional constraints that got more interesting. Each event has a minimum and maximum capacity, so if an event was over populated, some teams had to move to the second or third closest venue. This wasn\u2019t too hard to code, but I quickly realized, the solution I was getting was not necessarily the best. For example, in the diagram below, let\u2019s say the maximum capacity for each event is 3 teams, which means team \u201ci\u201d needs drive all the way to \u201cC\u201d. Clearly this is silly. It is better to move \u201cc\u201d to \u201cB\u201d and \u201cf\u201d to \u201cC\u201d, making room for \u201ci\u201d to join \u201cA\u201d, like this: But this is a tricky \u201cripple\u201d effect that is hard to find programmatically without having to essentially search all combinations of teams to events, but then I quickly realized it would take about 100 years to execute that kind of exhaustive search on my machine because 400 factorial is a large number. So this is when I contacted Microsoft Research. Lev Nachmanson works there and is a good friend of mine and a powerful magician when it comes to mathematics. So I presented the problem to him, and he said he\u2019d think about it. In a short while I got an email back saying he had a solution. He explained it to me over the phone, I implemented it, and it worked, finding the solution in less than a second. I was very impressed, but I also a bit skeptical. I couldn\u2019t believe it could be so simple. I went to his office to get a better understanding of how it worked. This is how he explained it to me. The global task is to drive to the minimum the sum of the distances from teams to the events they are assigned to. To initialize a solution assign each team to their closest event, but then think of the remaining optimization problem as a type of traffic flow problem. We will be shifting the teams between the events, so we need to consider a graph for doing this. The edges of this graph are AB, AC, and BC. (It is called a complete graph.) For example, above we moved \u201cc\u201d along edge AB, \u201cf\u201d along BC and \u201ci\u201d along AC. To find a solution we need to consider all paths on the complete graph that don\u2019t repeat an edge. A path can be a cycle, like ABCA, but every edge in it should appear at most once. To run one iteration, take a path as described above, then take the first edge of the path and shift a team along it such that shifting it along this edge \u201cmakes the least damage\u201d. Here the total sum can even grow. Take the second edge and do the same, and do it for every edge of the path. When we are done with the path, look at the total sum. If we are lucky and it went down, we accept the move, otherwise, we discard it. When no path gives us a gain we are done! Then how many possible paths do we have? Well in this case with 3 events there is AB, AC, BA, BC, CA, CB, ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CBA, CAB plus all the cyclic versions of these: ABA, ACA, BAB, BCB, CAC, CBC, ABCA, ACBA, BACB, BCAB, CBAC, CABC, a total of 24. It is not a huge amount of paths. The last thing to do for running the algorithm fast is to know how efficiently to find a team which can be shifted along an edge with the minimal damage. The best data structure for this is a priority queue. The end result was that on my desktop machine I could use this algorithm to find the optimal solution in sub-second times, which is fantastic.

I\u2019m having lots of fun working on it and learning all about Convolutional Neural Networks. The first time you train one and try it out it definitely feels like magic. How can a bunch of numbers correctly classify the type of object in a photo? Granted we\u2019re talking millions of numbers, so it\u2019s not that magical, but it is still fun. Now, of course, I have to combine this with my love of DGML graphs. So in this post I will outline how I\u2019ve used ELL to execute neural networks trained on the MNist dataset. MNist is a classic benchmark for neural networks and it provides a dataset for \u201chand written digits\u201d. This dataset is small since each image is only 28\u00d728 pixels, which makes for a great \u201cfirst time developer experience\u201d with neural networks, since you don\u2019t have to wait for terabytes of images to be downloaded! For example, here\u2019s one of their test images which contains a hand written digit \u201c8\u201d: It turns out the Microsoft CNTK library is an excellent library for training Neural networks and there is a CNTK sample that can be used to train an MNist model. See install_mnist.py . After you run that you will have the MNist dataset and then you can run SimpleMNIST.py to train a CNTK model on that dataset. On my machine I get a file named mnist.cntk which is about 640kb. So the next thing I want to do is run this on a Raspberry Pi, so I used the ELL library to do that. If you follow the Getting Started tutorial you will see how easy it is to build ELL, import a model from CNTK and build a cross-compiled module that will run on the Raspberry Pi. So in my case I simply do this (after building the ELL repo): python d:\\git\\ell\\ell\\tools\\importers\\CNTK\\cntk_import.py mnist.cntk This gives me an \u201cmnist.ell\u201d model, so what is inside this model? You can use the ELL print tool with -dgml and get this picture: Of course, this is a very simple neural network. Try the DGML graph on some of the more complex deep neural networks. You can then compile this model using the ELL model compiler: python d:\\git\\ell\\ell\\tools\\wrap\\wrap.py mnist.ell --target pi3 This gives me a \u2018pi3\u2019 folder already setup with CMakeLists.txt for building on the pi. You can also copy Demo.py and DemoHelpers.py from ELL\\tools\\utilities\\pythonlibs to get a quick start in using this python module. Once on the pi do the using cmake build thing outlined in the ELL tutorials, and then we can test it out. To test it out we can run this python script: import cv2 import numpy as np import sys sys.path += [ \"d:/Temp/MNist/host\" ] sys.path += [ \"d:/Temp/MNist/host/build\" ] sys.path += [ \"d:/Temp/MNist/host/build/Release\" ] import mnist import requests r = requests.get(\"http://www.lovettsoftware.com/images/eight.jpg\") nparr = np.fromstring(r.content, np.uint8) image = cv2.imdecode(nparr, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR) plt.imshow(image) gray = cv2.cvtColor(image,cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY) output = mnist.predict(gray.ravel()) result = np.array(output) print(\"Prediction={}\".format(np.argmax(result))) which prints the correct output, namely \u201c8\u201d. If you want to get adventurous you can run the ELL model over all the tests images in the MNist test dataset using this python code: import sys import cv2 import numpy as np sys.path.append(\"host\") sys.path.append(\"host/build\") sys.path.append(\"host/build/Release\") import mnist input_shape = mnist.get_default_input_shape() input_size = input_shape.rows * input_shape.columns * input_shape.channels output_shape = MNist.get_default_output_shape() output_size = output_shape.rows * output_shape.columns * output_shape.channels nogui = False failed = 0 total = 0 args = sys.argv[1:] if len(args) == 1 and args[0] == \"nogui\": nogui = True def getLabel(labels): a = labels.split(' ') if a[0] == 'labels': for i in range(10): if a[i+1] == \"1\": return i return 0 def getImage(features): a = features.split(' ') data = [] if a[0] == 'features': for i in range(len(a) - 1): data.append(float(a[i+1])) return np.array(data).reshape((28,28)) def Test(index, line): global total, failed, output_buffer parts = line.split('|') passed = True if len(parts) == 3: labels = parts[1] features = parts[2] answer = getLabel(labels) image = getImage(features) if not nogui: cv2.imshow(\"test\", image) output = mnist.predict(image.ravel()) prediction = np.argmax(output) result = \"passed\" if prediction != answer: result = \"failed\" failed += 1 passed= False total += 1 print(\"%d: predicted %d, answer is %d, test %s\" % (index, prediction, answer, result)) return passed def WaitForKey(): key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF while key == 255: key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF return key def RunTest(filename): global total, failed index = 1 with open(filename) as f: for line in f.readlines(): line = line.strip() passed = Test(index, line) index += 1 if not nogui and not passed and WaitForKey() == 27: return print(\"\") print(\"Total tests %d, failed = %d, pass rate = %f\" % (total, failed, (total - failed) / total)) RunTest(\"Test-28x28_cntk_text.txt\") Then the output from this is: Total tests 10000, failed = 259, pass rate = 0.974100 Lots \u2018o fun!","title":"Fun with ELL"},{"location":"posts/fun_with_ell/#having-fun-with-ell","text":"ELL is a new Open Source library from Microsoft Research.

To test it out we can run this python script: import cv2 import numpy as np import sys sys.path += [ \"d:/Temp/MNist/host\" ] sys.path += [ \"d:/Temp/MNist/host/build\" ] sys.path += [ \"d:/Temp/MNist/host/build/Release\" ] import mnist import requests r = requests.get(\"http://www.lovettsoftware.com/images/eight.jpg\") nparr = np.fromstring(r.content, np.uint8) image = cv2.imdecode(nparr, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR) plt.imshow(image) gray = cv2.cvtColor(image,cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY) output = mnist.predict(gray.ravel()) result = np.array(output) print(\"Prediction={}\".format(np.argmax(result))) which prints the correct output, namely \u201c8\u201d. If you want to get adventurous you can run the ELL model over all the tests images in the MNist test dataset using this python code: import sys import cv2 import numpy as np sys.path.append(\"host\") sys.path.append(\"host/build\") sys.path.append(\"host/build/Release\") import mnist input_shape = mnist.get_default_input_shape() input_size = input_shape.rows * input_shape.columns * input_shape.channels output_shape = MNist.get_default_output_shape() output_size = output_shape.rows * output_shape.columns * output_shape.channels nogui = False failed = 0 total = 0 args = sys.argv[1:] if len(args) == 1 and args[0] == \"nogui\": nogui = True def getLabel(labels): a = labels.split(' ') if a[0] == 'labels': for i in range(10): if a[i+1] == \"1\": return i return 0 def getImage(features): a = features.split(' ') data = [] if a[0] == 'features': for i in range(len(a) - 1): data.append(float(a[i+1])) return np.array(data).reshape((28,28)) def Test(index, line): global total, failed, output_buffer parts = line.split('|') passed = True if len(parts) == 3: labels = parts[1] features = parts[2] answer = getLabel(labels) image = getImage(features) if not nogui: cv2.imshow(\"test\", image) output = mnist.predict(image.ravel()) prediction = np.argmax(output) result = \"passed\" if prediction != answer: result = \"failed\" failed += 1 passed= False total += 1 print(\"%d: predicted %d, answer is %d, test %s\" % (index, prediction, answer, result)) return passed def WaitForKey(): key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF while key == 255: key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF return key def RunTest(filename): global total, failed index = 1 with open(filename) as f: for line in f.readlines(): line = line.strip() passed = Test(index, line) index += 1 if not nogui and not passed and WaitForKey() == 27: return print(\"\") print(\"Total tests %d, failed = %d, pass rate = %f\" % (total, failed, (total - failed) / total)) RunTest(\"Test-28x28_cntk_text.txt\") Then the output from this is: Total tests 10000, failed = 259, pass rate = 0.974100 Lots \u2018o fun!","title":"Having fun with ELL"},{"location":"posts/i_love_mylio/","text":"I love Mylio A good friend of mine named JP Duplessis joined a startup named Mylio and they built some really amazing photo management software. I\u2019ve been using it for over a year now and I have to say, I really like it. I was tired of the old Windows Photo Apps that are so, well, um, boring and feature limited and I was tired of my wife losing her MacBook and all her photos on it. You should have seen the moment when we set it up in my kitchen and I could finally sync photos off her MacBook onto my Windows PC for the first time. I thought I died and went to heaven !! I then added a bunch of photos from my son who is an avid photographer. He went on a hike in California (which is where he lives) and I would have never seen this photo, not in a million years of begging and pleading for photo backups. He works really hard in a startup and doesn\u2019t have time for facebook. But now, like magic using the Mylio Cloud Sync feature, it pops up on my machine and I can enjoy a whole series of amazing shots of this Tiger Swallowtail butterfly. So I\u2019m now using Mylio to sync over 90,000 photos across 9 machines (I have a PC, laptop, a PC at work, and a backup NAS drive, my wife has MacBook, iPad, and iPhone, and my son has Android phone and a MacBook running Windows). I hear some users have over 1 million photos and even more machines, and that makes me feel good about the scalability of this app. Nothing else came even close to \u201cmanaging\u201d this many photos, and Mylio is incredibly snappy. I can slice and dice and pivot through folders, albums, people, ratings, all to my heart\u2019s content and I\u2019m never waiting for a photo to load or for thumbnails to be generated. This snappiness is probably my favorite feature of the app. Who has time to wait for photos to load, like on all those \u201ccloud\u201d based photo sites? I don\u2019t.

It understands voice, and can produce aesthetic speech and sounds. Personal Assistant Security \u2013 first of all it only responds to the voice of its owner. The owner selects a name for it and addresses it this way. The data inside is locked up maybe even embedded in a kind of resin to avoid someone stealing it to break it open and hack into your personal information. (Chip makers use some techniques like this to avoid reverse engineering their designs). For the purpose of this paper, let\u2019s call it \u201cComputer\u201d \u2013 boring I know. Time Management \u2013 to help you wake up, make meetings on time, go to bed, a kid could easily teach it his school class schedule, music practice, etc. The night before: \u201cComputer, can you wake me up at six thirty?\u201d Computer: \u201cOk\u201d. 6:30am \u201cGood morning \u2026. (your name)\u2026\u201d followed by some wake up sound you\u2019ve downloaded into it from the web \u2013 let\u2019s say it is the sound of cockatoos screeching in Australia. 6:32am You: \u201cOk, I\u2019m getting up\u201d. The computer knows that it\u2019s a weekday and getting up is more important than on the weekend and has learned that you typically do not get up and that the best way to get you up is to ignore you and keep on playing the annoying sound. 6:50am You pounce out of bed, grab the box and because you are squeezing it it knows you\u2019re up. Computer: \u201cOk, ok\u201d and shuts off the music\u2026. Pause \u2026 then a warm greeting, slightly tongue in cheek, the computer says \u201cIts good to see you up and about this morning\u201d. 7:50am \u201cComputer, my first class is math right ?\u201d Computer: \u201cyep\u201d. 12:12am You get invited to a party on the weekend by some friends at school. You want to go, so you check your schedule. \u201cComputer, I\u2019m going to Matt\u2019s place Sunday afternoon\u201d. You don\u2019t ask for permission \u2013 you inform the computer so that it can help you in case there\u2019s a conflict. Computer: \u201cThere\u2019s a conflict at home do you want me to work it out ?\u201d. You: \u201cLater\u201d. You smile to your friend in a way that indicates you\u2019ll be there. The phrase \u201cat home\u201d was critical information from the computer to help you make the decision to be there. You remember now that you had a prior commitment to go hiking with your Dad, and you know your Dad is flexible on this. You don\u2019t even need to ask your computer in this case. Since you answered \u201cLater\u201d, the computer starts working on communicating with your Dad to let him know the hike is off. The computer will inform you about its progress on this front \u201cLater\u201d. This means after all your meetings, or after school in this case. The computer is wired so it sends an email to your Dads InnerSelf containing a structured scheduling message which it uses to update it\u2019s calendar. It returns a confirmation message saying it got it. 3:30: The computer detects you are on the bus because it\u2019s so noisy and then detects when you get off the bus because it becomes quiet, so it speaks, \u201cDad got your message\u201d. This prompts you to think about what you are going to say over dinner. You answer \u201cThanks\u201d, not realizing the computer doesn\u2019t even know you thanked it, since you didn\u2019t prefix it with \u201cComputer\u201d. 6:30pm: Dad \u201cSo, what\u2019s happening on Sunday?\u201d Your response is prepared. Several important things come up in this scenario: For prolonged use over several years, less is more. Absolutely efficient minimal communication makes for a lasting relationship between owner and computer. Is the computer really learning? No, it is just doing what you told it to do previously. Also it may be able to download new programming from the InnerSelf Web Service which simulates intelligence by trying fresh ideas on how to solve problems. This may be how it found the right way to wake you up in the morning. The central web service is where the psychologists are employed to make the Inner Self experience semi-intelligent. Colloquial language \u2013 how does it learn and understand this. Again, training from the user, and central web dictionaries. For example, you may respond to the computer with a new colloquial phrase it has never heard. Instead of bothering you on the spot to explain yourself, it first consults the central web dictionary to see if it can find an answer. There may even be real people on call behind the curtain so to speak, to help resolve this one. Now you see why massive storage is a requirement!! Diary A natural progression from day to day activities is to extend this and keep a diary of thoughts and feelings, ambitions and complaints. Diary entries are prefixed with a special prefix: \u201cLog: well, today was challenging and exhilarating. I really liked getting up in front of class and making everyone laugh. It was so scary, but when they all laughed at my jokes I felt on top of the world. Maybe I\u2019ll be a comedian one day\u201d. Now the computer also envelopes this with date/time stamp and enough context to understand what you were talking about. You can replay earlier diary entries: \u201cComputer, what did I think about Jeff two years ago?\u201d Jeff did something to offend you, and you want to think about Jeff for a while. The computer looks up a diary entry around the time you entered your first impressions of someone new that you met called Jeff, and it plays the recording. It was saved as text, but played in a simulation of your own voice. The computer helps you remember that Jeff has stuck with you as a friend through the years even when you have not treated him particularly well on some occasions. You decide to forgive Jeff and move on. This alone over several years becomes a massively powerful database of thoughts and ideas that help shape your life. The absolute ease of input is what makes this diary work for people where all other diary systems have failed. People forget so much \u2013 especially in this fast paced world we live in today. Again, massive, almost infinite storage that is virtually indestructible is a requirement. Counsellor Clearly, it is not a huge leap to connect the diary, and daily schedule with the ability to solve human problems. The key again is downloadable human intelligence working on your behalf, as follows: You \u201cComputer: Susan gets on my nerves soooo much !! Why does she always put me down and make me feel so stupid like that?\u201d Yikes, now the computer is being asked to guide a human being through the most important aspect of life \u2013 relationships. Here the computer draws upon a rule based system of knowledge about how to deal with people, the owner can configure which source of knowledge you would like it to use. For example, a religious person would give it the Bible. A Tony Robbins fan would point the computer at all his books. Tony Robbins may even provide a web service that connects to this device. The computer is trained to listen, empathise and respond abstractly. Imagine the following: Computer: \u201cSounds like Susan has hurt you like this before.\u201d You: \u201cYeah, I feel it\u2019s time to do something to get back at her, got any ideas?\u201d At this point, the computer has been asked for feedback, so it answers with a quote from the literature you have pointed it to previously, from the Bible it might say \u201cWell, a good rule to live by is to love your neighbor as yourself\u201d. You: \u201cOh, who said that?\u201d Computer: \u201cMoses, about 3 \u00bd thousand years ago\u201d. At this point it could turn into a history lesson and you could forget all about your troubles with Susan, or you could go off on a tangent and ask about career advice. To end the communication you say something like \u201cOk, thanks\u201d. Agent With wireless capabilities and back end web services supporting this device there are all sorts of opportunities to get the software to do real work on your behalf. We have already discussed several ways that this can occur, but lets look at a few more scenarios. \u201cComputer, I need a vacation!!\u201d Computer: \u201cwhere would you like to go, what would you like to do, how long, when do you want to go, how much would you like to spend, do you want to meet new people? etc, etc. Then over the course of the next week the computer, with help from back-end web services, scours the web for special deals and comes up with ideas, tuning it\u2019s search as it goes based on the feedback you give it. Computer: \u201cYou can go to Maui for just $439\u201d You: \u201cNah, too hot\u201d. This now limits the search down and so forth. Another Agent scenario is just an ongoing background ear-to-the-ground kind of service based on your own personal interests. For example, I happen to be interested in Australia, but it is extremely hard to find anything meaningful about Australia in American news. So the Agent goes to work for me and reports back what it found. You: \u201cComputer: What\u2019s new in Australia?\u201d Computer: \u201cI have information on Sports, Business, Weather, and People\u201d You: \u201cTell me about Business and the Olympics\u201d Computer: The computer reports business news relating to the Olympics. \u201cThey are building a new airport in Brisbane\u201d. You: \u201cWhat? Tell me more\u2026\u201d (This is where a voice interface gets really interesting, being able to drill in on stuff, without having to move and click a mouse!!) Later on, \u201cComputer, find me a Brisbane public official so I can send a complaint about this development\u201d. Again the computer acts as agent and helps you communicate your concerns to the city planning department. Perhaps you thought of something they didn\u2019t think of, like the airport might pollute the water supply of the last remaining habitat of the endangered Birdwing Butterfly. Combining your interests, with agents (or web services) that help you find interesting information and communicate efficiently with the right people at the right time results in a powerful combination. This sort of thing done on a global scale could have profound effects. For example, it would make corruption in government much harder to get away with because a lot more eyes and ears may be \u201cactively\u201d watching what they are doing \u2013 not just watching what is designed to be watched on TV, but actively probing and looking at things from different angles, in their own time, based on their own interests. Fun Toy The box includes some fun behaviors. For example, you drop it and it says \u201couch\u201d. It calculates a drop by using the movement transducers and the pressure transducers. Sudden acceleration combined with one side receiving pressure indicates it was either thrown, or dropped. Detecting moisture it may put on an under-water sound effect saying indignantly \u201cHey, I\u2019m drowning here!!\u201d This warns the user to do something to save their precious data, but conveyed in a way that gives it life-like qualities. It may download random human created toyish effects designed to use its powerful array of transducers in new and creative ways, giving it an continual freshness. Some sort of smell transducer could be interesting too. This toyness is really just an icebreaker between owner and device more than anything else \u2013 to help the owner place trust in the device. Conclusion A totally real voice interface, combined with lots of small effortless data inputs over a long period of time, and massive amounts of storage results in a device that will become indispensable to its owner. Clearly there are technical challenges. However, storage is continuing to increase at phenomenal rates, and despite the threat of reaching physical limits, new technologies like holographic storage seem promising. Also, with speech and voice, it is interesting to me that when this threshold is reached, a GUI for all this functionality is NOT needed, resulting in a device that has the potential to be a lot more indestructible than the delicate handheld devices we have today. There are also human challenges to overcome \u2013 like trust. Do I really trust this device not to leak information about me back to some central authority? What if I start talking crazy about guns? Does it notify the police? Well if you\u2019re in the High school cafeteria at the time, maybe it should discretely notify the school counselor! Anyway, this device is still a ways out, but technology is rapidly approaching that would make this possible, the result if executed will could be world changing.","title":"InnerSelf device vision from 1996"},{"location":"posts/inner_self/#innerself","text":"By Chris Lovett While driving home from work in 1996 I had the following vision of an amazing hand held device called \u201cInnerSelf\u201d.

The computer helps you remember that Jeff has stuck with you as a friend through the years even when you have not treated him particularly well on some occasions. You decide to forgive Jeff and move on. This alone over several years becomes a massively powerful database of thoughts and ideas that help shape your life. The absolute ease of input is what makes this diary work for people where all other diary systems have failed. People forget so much \u2013 especially in this fast paced world we live in today. Again, massive, almost infinite storage that is virtually indestructible is a requirement.","title":"Diary"},{"location":"posts/inner_self/#counsellor","text":"Clearly, it is not a huge leap to connect the diary, and daily schedule with the ability to solve human problems. The key again is downloadable human intelligence working on your behalf, as follows: You \u201cComputer: Susan gets on my nerves soooo much !! Why does she always put me down and make me feel so stupid like that?\u201d Yikes, now the computer is being asked to guide a human being through the most important aspect of life \u2013 relationships. Here the computer draws upon a rule based system of knowledge about how to deal with people, the owner can configure which source of knowledge you would like it to use. For example, a religious person would give it the Bible. A Tony Robbins fan would point the computer at all his books. Tony Robbins may even provide a web service that connects to this device. The computer is trained to listen, empathise and respond abstractly. Imagine the following: Computer: \u201cSounds like Susan has hurt you like this before.\u201d You: \u201cYeah, I feel it\u2019s time to do something to get back at her, got any ideas?\u201d At this point, the computer has been asked for feedback, so it answers with a quote from the literature you have pointed it to previously, from the Bible it might say \u201cWell, a good rule to live by is to love your neighbor as yourself\u201d. You: \u201cOh, who said that?\u201d Computer: \u201cMoses, about 3 \u00bd thousand years ago\u201d. At this point it could turn into a history lesson and you could forget all about your troubles with Susan, or you could go off on a tangent and ask about career advice. To end the communication you say something like \u201cOk, thanks\u201d.","title":"Counsellor"},{"location":"posts/inner_self/#agent","text":"With wireless capabilities and back end web services supporting this device there are all sorts of opportunities to get the software to do real work on your behalf. We have already discussed several ways that this can occur, but lets look at a few more scenarios. \u201cComputer, I need a vacation!!\u201d Computer: \u201cwhere would you like to go, what would you like to do, how long, when do you want to go, how much would you like to spend, do you want to meet new people? etc, etc. Then over the course of the next week the computer, with help from back-end web services, scours the web for special deals and comes up with ideas, tuning it\u2019s search as it goes based on the feedback you give it. Computer: \u201cYou can go to Maui for just $439\u201d You: \u201cNah, too hot\u201d. This now limits the search down and so forth. Another Agent scenario is just an ongoing background ear-to-the-ground kind of service based on your own personal interests. For example, I happen to be interested in Australia, but it is extremely hard to find anything meaningful about Australia in American news. So the Agent goes to work for me and reports back what it found. You: \u201cComputer: What\u2019s new in Australia?\u201d Computer: \u201cI have information on Sports, Business, Weather, and People\u201d You: \u201cTell me about Business and the Olympics\u201d Computer: The computer reports business news relating to the Olympics. \u201cThey are building a new airport in Brisbane\u201d. You: \u201cWhat? Tell me more\u2026\u201d (This is where a voice interface gets really interesting, being able to drill in on stuff, without having to move and click a mouse!!) Later on, \u201cComputer, find me a Brisbane public official so I can send a complaint about this development\u201d. Again the computer acts as agent and helps you communicate your concerns to the city planning department. Perhaps you thought of something they didn\u2019t think of, like the airport might pollute the water supply of the last remaining habitat of the endangered Birdwing Butterfly. Combining your interests, with agents (or web services) that help you find interesting information and communicate efficiently with the right people at the right time results in a powerful combination. This sort of thing done on a global scale could have profound effects. For example, it would make corruption in government much harder to get away with because a lot more eyes and ears may be \u201cactively\u201d watching what they are doing \u2013 not just watching what is designed to be watched on TV, but actively probing and looking at things from different angles, in their own time, based on their own interests.","title":"Agent"},{"location":"posts/inner_self/#fun-toy","text":"The box includes some fun behaviors.

Transcript : In this video I\u2019m going to explain how to use the DgmlTestMonitor that I published to the Visual Studio Gallery. I\u2019ve got a test project loaded here with some test methods and I have a DGML document. The Directed Graph Markup Language is supported by Visual Studio 2012 and it allows me to edit these diagrams. I created this diagram to model the user interface of an application that I\u2019m testing. Not only that, I have a way of executing this model and even setting breakpoints using the DgmlTestMonitor which you will find under View/Other Windows. Now I can come in here and set a breakpoint on this node. So whenever it gets into editing transactions and editing categories the model will stop executing. Alright, so let\u2019s run the test. Notice I don\u2019t actually have to debug the test to get these breakpoints. 1:00 : This is the application that I\u2019m testing, it\u2019s a simple financial management tool that allows me to create bank accounts and transactions and so forth, and right there it has edited a category and so the model has paused. So let\u2019s go back to the application and we see it sitting on that node and if we look at the DgmlTestMonitor output we can see everything that it has done up until that point. I can even select through here and watch what it did up until that point. 1:30 : If you put Visual Studio on another monitor you will be able to watch the model executing while it\u2019s actually testing the application. Now that\u2019s it\u2019s reached this point I\u2019m going to move the application to another monitor. Now we can watch the model executing. Maybe I want to stop it when it adds a transfer. I\u2019ll clear the previous breakpoint, tell it to resume, and off it goes. So the UI test is continuing, it\u2019s doing various different steps. Since I can watch the model executing I can get a feel for whether this is accurately modeling and end-user or not and I can edit the model, I can add links, I can add nodes and I can make the test do different things. 2:15 : Now in this case we hit a test bug because if we switch to the Test Explorer we see the test terminated when it was trying to set the date on a transaction. Now it turns out this is a product bug, sometimes setting the date is a little flakey. This is the kind of thing that model based testing is really good at, finding edge conditions that are really hard to find any other way, which is why I\u2019m a big fan of model based testing. I\u2019m not saying this is going to replace all static testing, but I think this is a very interesting thing to add to your suite of test tools. 2:45 : Alright, a lot of magic to explain here. How does this actually work? Let\u2019s take a look at the test code. The way you do this is with in normal MSTest [TestMethod] you create a new DgmlTestModel , you give it the filename of the DGML document that you want to load and then you tell the model to run until you\u2019re happy. I\u2019ve provided a Predicate that says run until 500 states have been executed. All right, now you pass in an object to the DgmlTestModel constructor which is the target object that implements the states - so the test model is connected to my code. If I double click this node it will take me to that method and this is the implementation of editing a category. Notice that there\u2019s lots of random number generation going on, some keystrokes to tab through various fields until it finds the category and so on. 3:43 : This framework doesn\u2019t change how you build test wrappers, you could use the CodedUI, I created these wrappers so I could automate, using System.Automation, the user interface of my application. What\u2019s new here is the way you can actually visually define the states that you want to travel through and the links that connect the states. So when I edit a category I can go over here or I can go down there and the test model execution decides randomly which of these paths to take that have multiple choices. 4:15 : When you create a group you can encapsulate the complexity of editing transactions and you can define an entrypoint, so a node that has the EntryPoint Category which you can define using the property window, you can add the entry points. You can also have entry points that are mutually exclusive, so if you choose this one, don\u2019t choose that one and so that has a category on it saying it is a singleton. You can define predicates on a link, so you can add link labels \u201cIsSecuritySelected\u201d we see that\u2019s just a implemented as a Boolean property. You can implement all kinds of state machinery in your Boolean properties which will then guide the test in the right way. For example, IsAccountSelected, or IsEditable and so forth. So all of these things can encode various state about what your application is doing to make sure your test model doesn\u2019t get stuck in a weird state and try to do something that\u2019s invalid. 5:16 : Now since it is random, you\u2019ll want to also be able to reproduce a failure and if you scroll to the bottom of the test output and you will see the \u201cModel Seed = 3122235\u201d. This number is the seed to the random number generator. If I plug this number in I will get the exactly the same test sequence that I got before. So basically you can create a static test by just copying down these seeds, which is a pretty low maintenance way of creating static regression tests. 5:43 : Ok, let\u2019s edit this model and see if we can make some changes here. So when we edit the payee we can go to SalesTax, or Deposit or Payment. Well maybe I always want to have salestax, so I just delete those links and maybe I want to have the memo field be optional, so instead of always going from EditCategory to EditMemo, I\u2019ll give it one more route from there to SelectTransaction and now I will only have EditMemo sometimes. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s all you have to do, save the document and re-run the test. Ok, we see it now adding a new transaction, that time it added a memo, this time it didn\u2019t, this time it did, and now it added a transfer and it stopped, so let\u2019s see what happened. 6:43 : Ah, that\u2019s because we have a breakpoint on AddTransfer, remember? So I can go to the DgmlTestMonitor and we can see that it hit a breakpoint on that node and I can tell it to resume running the test. You can also pause the test at any time, using the pause button, which is handy for a UI test because often interrupting a UI test is kind of tricky but when you tell the model to pause it\u2019s usually in a pretty good place. 7:18 : Alright, so, one more thing and that is you can modify the thickness of these links. If you go to the Property Window this link has a priority of 10 which means it\u2019s going to pick that link more often than this link with Priority 1. This way you can weight the model so that it\u2019s doing various things in a way that\u2019s similar to the way a real user would use your product. 7:40 : Lastly, when the model enters a group, like View Categories, notice there\u2019s no exit links from SelectCategory. Just to make it simple to create these models what happens when it hits a leaf node that has no exit, it will jump back up to the parent group and it will use any exit links that the parent has, and if the parent doesn\u2019t have any exit links then it will go back to the root and look for an entry point there, and re-entry the model at the root and keep executing from there. So that makes it easy, you don\u2019t have to specify all possible exit routes and it makes your model a little bit simpler. 8:18 : That\u2019s it! I hope you like it. I\u2019ve posted a blog on my website, and in there you\u2019ll see a readme that points to the source code that you can download so you can play with it, including sample code on how to wire it up and also documentation on this class, DgmlTestModel. You will find DgmlTestModel and also the NamedPipeReader that listens to the model while it\u2019s executing in case you want to build your own user interface.

Thanks for watching!","title":"Model Based UI Testing using DGML"},{"location":"posts/mymoney.net/","text":"MyMoney.Net is now open source\u2026 A good friend of mine, JP Duplessis and I have been tinkering away on an app for the last 10 years or more, it started out as a replacement for the then cancelled Microsoft Money app. We built it entirely in C#, it started out as WinForms, we ported it to WPF and XAML and then fixed bugs. We wanted to open source it but I finally got around to doing it today on GitHub. See https://moneytools.github.io/MyMoney.Net/ . The app is really designed for programmers who want to tinker and add stuff. JP added a whole module to help deal with rental properties. The data is stored in sqllite, so it is super easy to extend and add whatever you want. The surprising thing is how small financial data really is. For a family of 5 with data all the way back to 1997 (which I exported in QFX format from Microsoft Money and my wife\u2019s data from Quicken) the entire database is just over 6 megabytes. In today\u2019s hard drive world, this is miniscule. So MyMoney.Net loads up the entire database into memory, which means it is super snappy to pivot, slice and dice and jump around your accounts. You might wonder how long it takes to load, ooh, about 1.2 seconds ?? So anyway, I hope a few other people can enjoy the app, and contribute on GitHub. I look forward to many interesting pull requests. -Cheers, Chris.","title":"MyMoney.Net is now open source..."},{"location":"posts/mymoney.net/#mymoneynet-is-now-open-source","text":"A good friend of mine, JP Duplessis and I have been tinkering away on an app for the last 10 years or more, it started out as a replacement for the then cancelled Microsoft Money app. We built it entirely in C#, it started out as WinForms, we ported it to WPF and XAML and then fixed bugs.

NEW: I\u2019ve also added a windows store app, see Secure Password Vault app and associated new demo video . Managing online accounts is a real hassle these days. I have 180 separate userids and passwords to manage. Who can remember all that? And it\u2019s not just userids and passwords any more, it\u2019s also secret questions, password images, secure credit card numbers, links to specific URLs, license keys, and all sorts of other miscellaneous information associated with my online accounts. The temptation of course is to get sloppy and use the same user id and password on every site and use real \u201csecret\u201d questions that I can remember but a wise person once said \u201cdon\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket\u201d. If a hacker breaks into one site I don\u2019t want them to be able to steal my entire identity across all my other accounts, so I\u2019ve diligently kept separate unique userids and passwords on every site and fake random unique secret questions. I also use strong passwords, combinations of digits, letters, and other special characters. But managing all this unique secure information for every account is a big hassle. Up till now I\u2019ve used a password encrypted Microsoft Word file. Being a free-form text editor Word lets me paste anything I want, including all those annoying \u201csecret questions\u201d, even password image keys that some sites are now using, like Bank of America. But I want these passwords to be readily available on every machine that I use. Since the Word document is itself password encrypted, I can store it on my OneDrive folder which is automatically copied to all my machines. But then if I edit the password file on one machine while it is offline then edit the file on another machine before it syncs then I have a conflict and will have to manually merge the two slightly different Word documents which is a real hassle. So I wanted something that is a bit more structured that can handle automatic merging for me, but also without losing the flexibility of free form text editing for all that other random information besides the core web site, userid and password fields. So I built Password Vault . The screen shot below shows a typical password file. Highlighted in various shades of green are the most recent changes. This green highlight fades over time, disappearing after one month. When you select a row the 5th field appears containing a full rich text editor where you can paste any other details like secret questions or even an image key. You can cut & paste anything you want into this field and and it can be as big as you want. This field is also searchable. When the program first starts the focus will be on the search field since you typically have some place in mind already before you launch the app. After you type in your search term (which is not case sensitive) the view will automatically filter down to show any matching rows: From there you can select the row you want and press F12 to open that URL, and then you can copy the user name and password into the web site login page. Implementation I realize there\u2019s a million similar apps out there, I just wanted to see how easy it would be to build one. The following is the solution I came up with. Design.dgml (276.06 kb) PasswordVault is about 1000 lines of code and shows the power of .NET Framework. It uses the .NET Cryptography api to encrypt/decrypt your password files using 256 bit encryption, and it uses WPF for the User Interface including a RichTextBox for the free form text editing part.

I was recently struggling to debug a new problem that showed up in the PX4 Firmware with regards to Hardware in the loop (HITL) simulation and the AirSim simulator . Then I remembered I have this great tool\u2026 See demo video: Here\u2019s something fun for PX4 developers. If you look in the modules/uORB folder you\u2019ll see the pub/sub infrastructure called the \u201cmicro-orb\u201d which is used for pub/sub messaging throughout the PX4 firmware. But knowing where messages are coming from and where they are going to can end up being quite a maze to figure out. So if we search for every instance of ORB_ID in the PX4 source code using this command: grep -r . -e 'ORB_ID(' you\u2019ll see lots of different uses. You\u2019ll see orb_publish calls and you\u2019ll see orb_subscribe calls. So if we capture all this output of this grep in a text file orbids.txt then we can process that file with my graph_orbids.py python script. This script builds a graph of Nodes and Links which it can then save in a .dot or .dgml file format. For the orb_publish calls it will create a node representing the module that is publishing with a link to another node representing the orb topic. For the orb_subscribe calls it will create a node representing the module that is subscribing, with a link from another node representing the orb topic. When you run the tool it will output anything it didn\u2019t understand, so check that output to make sure it didn\u2019t miss anything important. Now you have a graph.dgml file which you can load up in Visual Studio. You will see a large complex graph of all the pub/sub stuff going on. You can use the Legend to make the topic nodes green. But the graph is pretty big an horrendous to look at which is kind of why its so hard to debug the PX4 until you fully understand this picture. But if you install my DgmlPowerTools extension for Visual Studio then you can slice and dice this graph a little more easily. For example, I was investigating a problem with actuator_outputs . So I can search for this topic, then select the Neighborhood Mode button in the toolbar to hide everything that is not 1 link away from this topic and you get this nice clean sub-graph: . This subgraph helped me fix the bug I was hunting. I found that version 1.7 of the PX4 firmware contains the pwm_out_sim module, but version 1.8 does not. Adding it back fixed my bug and HILT mode simulation works again in AirSim. From here it\u2019s fun to pivot around the graph recentering each subgraph on a new module or topic. For example, if you look a the commander 1 link away you see all the various topics the commander subscribes to, but you can see it is also publishing a bunch of stuff, like vehicle_status . You can recenter the graph on vehicle_status and see what it connects to: From there you can see position control module (mc_pos_control) uses this, and you can easily pivot to see that node\u2019s local neighborhood: The position controller subscribes to a bunch of things and produces one output which is used to move the drone. Following that output we find that the land_detector uses this message as follows: Who uses land_detected? Let\u2019s find out: Interesting eh? Here we see ekf2 which is the fancy new position estimator And you can see from this picture that it is doing something pretty complicated fusing together lots of inputs to figure out where the drone is headed next. One of the outputs is vehicle_attitude, which is an estimated attitude (or angle) of the drone. Let\u2019s see who uses that: Whoah, lots of people. So you can see this is a handy way to slice and dice a complex graph. In Visual Studio you can choose different layouts like \u2018left-to-right\u2019 and find what you like best. Anyway, I found this useful so I hope you do too.","title":"Using DGML to understand PX4"},{"location":"posts/px4_topics/#using-dgml-to-understand-px4","text":"As you may know I have a soft spot for Directed Graphs and I enjoy showing off what you can do with DGML diagrams and Visual Studio .

But in order to scroll then I needed to adjust the canvas position of the path to the left, well turns out I can do the scrolling at a higher rate than the point adding which results in a very smooth scroll which looks great. The problem is I would run out of memory if I never removed points, so what I do is cycle two Path objects, when one is completely offscreen on the left, I recycle it and use it on the right, and this is how I get really nice performance on the Surface.

Good question. There are, of course, many books on the subject but these are the things that have helped me along the way: Write a huge amount of code. Millions of lines. This gives you a deep grounding in the issues faced by developers everywhere. I have seen many \u201carchitects\u201d get lost in the clouds, they lose perspective if they stop day to day writing code. Find teams that have the best software engineers on the planet and join those teams. I\u2019ve learned so much from working with amazing people like Erich Gamma, Anders Hejlsberg, Erik Meijer, Clemens Szyperski, Herman Venter, and many others. Learn every product you work on top to bottom, don\u2019t live just in your own little corner of the product. I know that\u2019s hard with some huge products. But nothing is stopping you from learning the whole system top to bottom. Use tools to help you understand how it works (logging, diagramming tools, debuggers). Pretty soon you will find people coming to you to pick your brains. One of my favorite saying is \u201cThere is Genius in Simplicity\u201d . Do not be satisfied with a solution until you have gotten to the core essence of the problem so you can deliver an elegantly simple solution. So very much software out there does not achieve this kind of Simplicity and we all need to work much harder to achieve this. Simplicity is not easy to achieve. Have you noticed that a professor that really really knows their stuff is able to make something really complex seem simple? But a professor who is new is not so good at explaining the same thing? This is what I mean by \u201cgenius of simplicity\u201d. The person who truly understands the problem area deeply usually does the best job of coming up with a \u201csimple architecture\u201d that \u201cjust works\u201d and scales. A perfect example of this is git . Many source control systems existed before git , but they all fell over due to complexity, they contained bugs, data would go missing when you merged branches, or a branch merge would take 12 hours, by which time there were conflicts again, and so on, it was horrendous what we had to put up with. Linus Torvalds was also fed up with other CVS systems and decided to write his own, and he thought long and deeply about it and got to the core essence of the problem, and built git .

Linus could have made git much simpler if it didn\u2019t support branches. But of course then you\u2019d have a simplistic toy. I\u2019m talking about beautiful elegant design, those are the ones that achieve true \u201cgenius of simplicity\u201d. Products that achieve this tend to have a very long life. We all need to do better at achieving this in our own products. And we need to push back on the tyranny of the urgent. One time I was on a product that made a terrible decision to ship something that cost the team 2 years of embarrassing bug fixing, simply because it would have taken 3 weeks to fix it before we shipped and that was \u201ctoo much work\u201d and wouldn\u2019t fit the schedule according to the PM\u2019s at the time.

Too often we are tempted to cut critical features to meet a deadline and we justify it by calling it the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). I say we should instead be shooting for the Minimum Lovable Product (MLP) and to achieve that you need a kind of functional completeness that delights the customer. When a customer hits a critical missing feature they fall off a cliff of complexity trying to work around that hole. Any product that does this to a customer has completely missed the target on \u201cgenius of simplicity\u201d. It is simplicity in the core design of the product, and simplicity of \u201cuse\u201d by customers. Both are equally important. Most PM\u2019s think simplicity of \u201cuse\u201d by customers is the only thing that is important. I say you can\u2019t deliver that without simplicity in the core design of the product.

I built a light weight profiling tool that shows you exactly that. Let me show you how it works. To get started you click the Launch button and find the application you want to profile and immediately we see a bunch of activity showing what\u2019s happening as the app launches. This dashboard is showing a roll up across the top level Namespaces and the counters are showing the total number of function calls in each area. You can scroll down and see everything that is going on. We can see that there are some Microsoft namespaces, but there\u2019s also a Walkabout namespace which happens to be the code for this application. So I can take a look at startup again without the .NET frameworks by drilling down into the Walkabout namespace - this shows me the drill down path and the green blocks represent classes and namespaces and the white blocks represent method calls. So we can now see that we\u2019re getting down to the method call level - maybe we\u2019re interested in seeing what happens during LoadConfig and we can click that method and it will search the call information and build a conglomerate call stack graph basically showing a combination of all call stacks that it has seen involving that method Loadconfig. And from this you can actually explore down into WPF or you can explore upwards and see what those function calls are doing. You can also try and expand the entire graph but in this case it\u2019s not recommended because the graph is huge. When you\u2019re done exploring the call stack you can close that and go back to the dashboard. You can also Filter this information - so maybe I care about anything involving the word \u201cTransaction\u201d and I can see that during the launching of the application that there\u2019s some Transactions Namespaces and I can also see that it shows up over here in the View namespace. Let\u2019s drill down into some controls and we see a class named TransactionView. At any point you can clear the buffer and start over and go back to and remember to clear the filter. When I do that I can see that there\u2019s actually a heart-beat going on with this application and the reason for that if I drill into the MainWindow is that there\u2019s an OnTick method that is being fired by a DispatcherTimer. Ok, let\u2019s go back over here and let me show you more about this application that I\u2019m profiling. Let me just disconnect for a second (you can disconnect at any time if you want to just pause the profiling). I\u2019m going to load some sample data into this application. It\u2019s basically a personal finance application like Quicken and I\u2019m going to show you the real scenario that I\u2019d like to debug, so now I have some sample data, the scenario that I want to debug is drag/drop - I want to find out why drag drop isn\u2019t working in this window here. Alright, so I can now reconnect back to that application, the profiler is ready for work, probably want to go back home, and let\u2019s run the drag/drop scenario. We see a lot of activity, 16 million function calls already, even after clearing the buffer, I see some stuff in the Walkabout namespace, and the System namespace, so let me apply a filter again and just search for anything containing the word \u201cDrag\u201d. Now I could look at the Walkabout code, but first I want to take a look at the .NET frameworks. So in the history of calls that we have in the buffer, this is everything that WPF does to implement Drag/Drop. This gives me a really great place to start looking up documentation on MSDN to find out what these methods do, OnDragOver, OnDragEnter, OnDragLeave and so on, and also I see a method called DoDragDrop which sound like an interesting place to start, let\u2019s take a look at that method, and if I look at the caller, well it\u2019s this class called MoneyDataGrid. So now we know the class over here in the UI is called MoneyDataGrid. So now if we go back to the Walkabout namespace, there I can see the Controls namespace and the Views namespace and I can see the classed called MoneyDataGrid. This is the guy that starts the drag/drop operation - so let\u2019s remove the filter and take a closer look at everything he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s getting the mouse move which begins the drag/drop operation and here we see a flag called \u201cget_SupportDragDrop\u201d and we see the OnQueryContinueDrag method which the MSDN documentation tells us is used by WPF to figure out whether the drag/drop operation should continue. So let\u2019s select OnQueryContinueDrag and see what it calls. Now I have an excellent place to go and look in the code - it\u2019s in MoneyDataGrid, to find out why when I drag this window nothing happens. Now if I clear the buffer and do it again, now I can see in real time a lot of these mouse moves come in, I see the call to get_SupportDragDrop and so on. So being able to see in real time what\u2019s happening, for example, when I do mouse moves, it\u2019s is a really useful way to see what\u2019s going on in my code. I can also see that when I wiggle the mouse there are lots and lots of function calls, so if I\u2019m worried about performance at all, that counter down there, plus the rollup for each Namespace is going to be a great way to figure out where I need to optimize and see if I can remove some of those calls and get better performance. Profiling Very Large Applications Ok, enough of that application. Now what about a bigger application? I\u2019m going to launch Visual Studio - Visual Studio consists of a huge amount of code. I want to see what the overhead then is of the profiler in launching Visual Studio. Already we can see all the .NET framework stuff that\u2019s happening, and Visual Studio is already up and running in about 10 seconds. So we can also see here that in order to launch Visual Studio it takes about 46 million function calls, but there\u2019s only about 15 thousand unique functions. Again, here\u2019s the top level view, I can see the Microsoft.VisualStudio namespace, which is where all the Visual Studio code lives so I can drill down and re-run the launch scenario and I can see everything that happens in the Microsoft.VisualStudio namespace when it launches. I can see stuff in the Platform, in the Shell, there\u2019s some Packages, let\u2019s see what package is doing, and drill down, and so on. The breadcrumb toolbar allows you to go jump back up to any level that I want. Let\u2019s go back to VisualStudio. Now the same thing can be done - let\u2019s say I want to explore a drag/drop scenario inside Visual Studio with the \u201cDrag\u201d filter. First let\u2019s clear the 50 million function call history, that was quick, and let\u2019s load a DGML graph so we can explore drag/drop in DGML. First off when I load the graph I can already see a bunch of classes, \u201cGraphDragDrop\u201d, and \u201cDragSourceGesture\u201d and these are getting fired up inside Visual Studio, so that\u2019s promising. Those things will probably add drag/drop support. Let\u2019s zoom in and grab one of these nodes, and do a drag/drop. Just as before I\u2019m able to see in real-time everything that\u2019s happening - the DragSourceGesture did a lot of work, let\u2019s drill into that and take a look at that again, ok, I\u2019ve got too much stuff in my buffer, let\u2019s clear that and do the drag/drop again, and instantly we see exactly what\u2019s happening deep down inside Visual Studio to support that Drag/Drop operation and now I know where to find the code and set breakpoints and continue my debugging. So I think you\u2019ll find that this profiler scales up to some pretty big software. Testing I think this tool will also make a great testing companion. For example, if you own a document editor then there\u2019s a special call deep down in the VS shell called \u201cReleaseDocument\u201d that needs to happen when your document window is closed. Bang, all right, so deep inside this Visual Studio namespace, inside WindowManagement, there should be a call to ReleaseDocument. If that doesn\u2019t happen you have a pretty bad memory leak in your editor. So this tool is a great way to do an ad hoc test that certain things are happening when they are supposed to. That\u2019s it, I hope you enjoy it, please send your comments to my blog.

If that doesn\u2019t happen you have a pretty bad memory leak in your editor. So this tool is a great way to do an ad hoc test that certain things are happening when they are supposed to. That\u2019s it, I hope you enjoy it, please send your comments to my blog.

I held off raving about it because I wanted to make sure it wasn\u2019t just the honey moon phase that had me gushing about all the wonderful features. 2 1/2 years is long enough, I should know all the dirt by now, meaning I can now write a balanced review from my real day to day usage. While I will be the first to admit that Tesla has not achieved any huge breakthroughs in build quality, they have achieved a new level of customer delight because of their end-to-end customer experience . The best analogy I can think of is that Tesla is to cars what Apple is to phones. A revolution in user experience. But before I get into that, let me list all the problems I have had with this car. Paint While driving the car home from California to Seattle, I got stuck in a blizzard behind a salt truck in Oregon and the truck was dumping giant 1 inch round salt rocks on the road which promptly bounced off the road and right onto my car. This left some nasty marks on the hood. Then not long after I had it home I dropped the charging cable down the side of the car which left a scratch on my driver\u2019s door. So I found out the hard way that Tesla puts on a pretty thin paint job. So I decided to get a Vinyl Wrap for my entire car. It was expensive, but it has kept the car in pristine condition as you can see in the photo. Doors & Trim Early on the plastic clips holding the passenger side interior door together came off when someone slammed the door too hard. I took it in to get repaired, which they did quickly and for free. No more problems in this area. One piece of chrome trim wasn\u2019t aligned very well and they promptly fixed this when I pointed it out. Sensors The vinyl wrap interfered with my parking sensors, but I didn\u2019t know that for a while. I took it in for service, the service department was fantastic and did everything including replacing the entire sensor module, and then advised that I remove a dot over each sensor location. Bingo everything is great. So this was entirely my fault (and the fault of the company that did the wrap - they should have known better). So lesson learned, if you get a vinyl wrap make sure they do not cover the sensors. So what do I like about it? Everything. The car greets me by extending the door handles as I approach. This seems silly, but it forms a bond over time, it makes the car seem alive, anticipating my every need. The seats are extremely comfortable. I used to own a Volvo and I thought they had the best seats. This one is better. I\u2019ve driven around 15,000 miles, mostly commuting about 10 miles to work and back every day, but I\u2019ve also done some road trips to Oregon and Vancouver B.C. The car and all the electronics have worked perfectly. I use all the auto-pilot features, adaptive cruise control; auto-steering to keep me in my lane; summon, to get the car out of a tight parking spot, and more. But for some reason the NTSB is picking on Tesla because of a few idiots that chose to ignore all of Tesla\u2019s warnings about paying attention while driving. The car is not autonomous . Any sane driver will know this. Those that choose to believe otherwise are just idiots. But blaming Tesla for these fatalities is like blaming Ford for making a car that someone fell asleep in. Where are all the NTSB reports covering the other 37133 fatalities that happened in 2017? I have a completely different view than the NTSB. Adaptive Cruise Control Rocks This is not your average crappy cruise control. Because of regenerative breaking the first thing you will notice is that the car nails the speed you set and just sticks there. It\u2019s like a gymnast sticking the landing every time. It is flawless. Remember those old gas powered cars that would run away down hill and your cruise control was useless? A thing of the past. This feature is super useful in mind numbing bumper-to-bumper traffic because it can stay engaged all the way to stopped and then back to moving again. Regenerative Braking Speaking of regenerative braking, I absolutely love it. Not only do I get the thrill of seeing 50,000 Watts get pumped back into my battery but I also get the lovely green line of greenness on my dashboard power usage display reminds me that my car is making the world a better place. When I drive by a gas station my thumb always ends up on my nose, and my fingers start wiggling. Every now and then my tongue also makes a funny raspberry sound. It never gets old. It takes some getting used to, because when you lift your foot off the pedal, the regenerative braking kicks in. This is configurable, but the standard setting has really grown on me. I love the sense of control this gives me now. When I get into an old car and lift my foot the car just wanders off on it\u2019s own, rolling away until I put my foot on the brake. This now freaks me out, it\u2019s like the old car has a mind of it\u2019s own, it is not doing what I told it and I have to punish it with a slap on the brakes. The regenerative braking is also saving my brake pads big time. When I got back home California, an 855 mile drive, I still had factory paint on the inside of the brake pads because I hardly ever use the brakes. Super Charging On my way home from California I used 3 super charging stations. Getting back to 80 % full in 20 minutes is amazing. I love how new stations keep popping up everywhere. On my trip to Vancouver the super charger was right in the down town area so I could walk from there to my business appointment. By the time I got back the car was full and ready for my trip home. So I spent absolutely no time standing around picking my nose while getting high on gas fumes! Electric charging is actually saving me time. This is such an amazing user experience. At home I have the high power wall charger which has also worked flawlessly, keeping my car topped up at all times. I love how you can schedule when the car charges, and reduce the top limit so Tesla can keep all battery cells balanced and in good condition. I have not seen any noticeable drop in battery capacity since the day I bought the car. Auto-steering On roads with clear lane markings the car allows me to enter an auto-pilot mode where the car will keep itself in the lane. It\u2019s not perfect, and that is ok. What I have found is that it allows me to better keep tabs on the big picture of what is happening around me rather than the mind numbing problem of micro-steering. I know for sure this has helped me avoid some dangerous situations because I was looking down a side street, or way down the road at something going on ahead of me. One time I also noticed someone behind me was not going to stop, so I pulled into a different lane. I also found that I feel much more relaxed when I get to work because the car has taken over all the mind numbing parts of driving. Recently they added a new feature which is auto-lane changing when I turn on the indicator. Nice! Show me any other car that \u201ckeeps getting better\u201d over time. Navigation The huge navigation screen is awesome, and the smaller turn-by-turn directions behind the steering wheel is a really nice touch. They have also shipped several updates that have greatly improved the navigation system. What do people do a lot in cars? They try to get someplace. It just makes so much sense to nail this scenario. I think Tesla has the worlds best car navigation experience, and probably will continue to for a long time to come. Software Updates A car that gets regular software updates, it is hilarious how far ahead of the competition they are on this front. I was nervous at first thinking they would one day push it too far and brick the car with a bad update. But each update has been flawless. Knock on wood. When I get the update notification my heart skips and it\u2019s like Christmas all over again as I read up on all the new coolness they are packing into my car. Every other car company wants to chalk up your purchase in the black column and never hear from you again, lest you cost them more money. Not Tesla. Tesla wants to build a lasting relationship, raving fans, and it\u2019s working. Entertainment All the multi-media features are state of the art. Integration with my iPhone is great. Being able to heat up my car from my office on those cold winter nights is delectable. I use the radio, and the built in music channels, PBS radio and so on. All work perfectly every time. But the feature that really brought a lot of chuckles in my family was the \u201cFart on demand\u201d feature. Yes, I kid you not. I can press a button on the screen and make the seat under any unsuspecting passenger make a juicy 9.0 fart sound. My wife also loves the \u201cRomantic mode\u201d that turns the big screen into a fire place perfect for us to snuggle by. What other car company in the world would have dared to ship such crazy easter eggs? Conclusion The thing I keep coming back to is that Tesla has nailed end-to-end user experience. The way the car greets me, interior comfort, world class navigation, auto-pilot keeping me relaxed and happy on the road, high power charging, even the purchasing experience was more fun than previous cars I\u2019ve bought. It was about as easy as buying a new flashlight from Amazon. So while they have not nailed build quality, I think everything else Tesla has done is game changing. I\u2019m sure they will also revolutionize build quality one of these days as their manufacturing processes mature. Tesla has survived despite all the nay sayers. I think they know what they are doing. Tesla is a fast moving, innovative company. They are willing to play and have fun while they work their asses off making the world\u2019s best cars. I can\u2019t wait to see what they come up with next.","title":"My Telsa Model S"},{"location":"posts/tesla/#my-tesla-model-s","text":"Ok, it has been over 2 years now that I have been the proud owner of a Tesla Model S.

I love gardening and I first learned about this really good Tower Garden at Microsoft where they have a bunch of them around campus and they used to grow food for the salad bar back in those days when people used to actually go into the office. So instead of waiting for coronavirus to piss off I decided to splurge a little and get myself one of these nifty indoor vertical gardens. I\u2019m happy to report assembly was easy, and within practically no time at all I was loaded with fresh greens. I still have a vege garden outside, but out there I have to constantly battle with the rabbits, deer, and the ever present slugs. Indoors the produce is so perfect it is crazy, every leaf is full vibrant perfection, not the slightest damage from pests, and with no insecticides it is super healthy and ready to eat any time. The thing runs itself, it has automatic lighting on 12 hours per day and the tank holds lots of water and a automatic timer on the pump runs the water down the inside of the tower ever 15 minutes so, no matter what, the plants are happy. Once a week I top up the tank with fresh water with these nutrients they provided, about 20ml per gallon: Then the last step is to keep the pH balanced. My filtered tap water is about pH 7.1, but the nutrients are slightly acidic, so normally I need about a teaspoon of alkali to keep the tank in the recommended range of 5.5 to 6.5. They provided a nice little test kit: So this is about 10 minutes once a week. Planting is easy whenever I devour one of the plants that is ready for harvesting I simply plop in a new starter. You can buy the starter plants from Tower Garden, or grow them yourself from seeds. They provide an easy way to do that too. All up the entire system works really well. I\u2019ve had it now for about 2 months and it has produced all the leafy greens I need for me and Heidi for the last month already. I also have some yummy herbs growing, from Chocolate Mine, to Italian Parsley, and a huge basil. I\u2019ve never seen such huge basil leaves before and they taste amazing. Tinkering\u2026 Of course, I would not be satisfied with just that, I need to tinker with it. My son, Zach, found this awesome hydroponic system built by Kyle Gabriel . So that\u2019s my target, the most useful thing to start with is automated pH sensing. Karl chose really nice pH sensor from Atlas Scientific for his system so I got the same one from Amazon. I also wanted to use my Teensy 4.1 with the Ethernet Kit because it can talk directly to the sensor over UART, and serve up a nice little HTTP server on my local network. Getting it hooked up was easy, just drop the sensor in the tank: and connect it to my Teensy, plug my Teensy into the network and voil\u00e0 ! Any web browser in my house can now check the pH levels: Great. So no need for the liquid pH test kit, I now have a much more accurate number. Here I see a pH level of 5.9 which is ok. I see an very quick response any time I add acid or alkali to the tank. The Teensy 4.1 source code lives here https://github.com/lovettchris/SmartGarden .

To understand the failure, you first have to go back to the phenomenal success of iPhone. Remember before iPhone there was, way back as far as 2000, palm pilots, and the Windows CE powered Compaq iPAQ and there were flip phones and everyone knew these were going to merge. Apple had also worked for a decade on their Apple Newton as far back as 1995. I was on an internal task force in 2003 that recommended we merge phones and handheld devices as soon as possible but failed to convince the VP of Microsoft mobile at the time. He was focused on \u201cslate\u201d devices instead and we all know who was talking about slates back then. While Microsoft could have beaten Apple to market, they decided to do nothing. Microsoft was very distracted with the big security push and the DOJ at the time. This gave Apple the time they needed to perfect their iPhone and stun the market in 2007 with a gorgeous premium device that every tech geek just had to have. Notice the first iPhone had no app store, so it was not all about apps back then, it was about the best possible \u201cexperience\u201d, and this could not have happened without a deal with AT&T. Did Steve Jobs know that a killer phone would create demand from developers? Their next release they opened up an SDK and off to the races on apps. They kept a high bar on their apps too which was in line with their premium brand. In the meantime, Google took the low road and shipped a free operating system, Android, also unveiled in November 2007, clearly Google was working on this long before. Now remember that iOS is based on the XNU kernel of Darwin which is a Unix-like operating system. This meant iOS apps could use all kinds of open-source Linux friendly libraries for computer vision, encryption, https, etc. Android is also built on a Linux Kernel and so Android developers found it very easy to port their apps over from iOS. This allowed Google to amass millions of apps almost overnight. Android was also hugely helped by the partnership with Samsung who consistently shipped the best tech specs for each new phone they came out with. So again, success cemented by key partnerships. Then late to the party along comes Windows Phone 7 an entirely 3 years later in 2010, wow talk about late to the party. Microsoft chose Nokia as a partner and Nokia phones used Qualcomm chipsets. This phone provided only a .NET SDK, so none of the C++ open-source libraries from iOS or Android apps could be leveraged. Apps had to be built from scratch. I claim all the app developers could have chosen to do this and would have gotten lots of apps up and running in a few months, but most chose not to. Why? Because after Microsoft cancelled Zune & Kin, developers didn\u2019t believe Microsoft had a winning strategy, and the SDK was not rich enough to build interesting apps anyway and with no shared code across the 3 phone platforms, Windows usually drew the short straw. Along came Windows Phone 8 in 2012 with a C++ SDK, but the Kernel was Windows based, and therefore again, all those Linux friendly open-source libraries used in iOS and Android apps could not be easily ported to Windows Phone. Microsoft recognized this problem and tried to create their own open source libraries, but it was too little too late. Also, UWP was not Win32 so folks couldn\u2019t even use established Win32 code either. Microsoft should have followed Android and started off with a Linux compatible phone, but back then Ballmer was very anti-Linux, and that is where Microsoft really shot themselves in the foot on the technical side. Apple had taken the high road, Google took the low road, which was traditionally Microsoft\u2019s strong position with the open PC industry, where anyone can build a PC and apps for it. So, there was no room for Microsoft. Oddly, Microsoft tried to copy Apple but could never deliver the same premium quality. Nokia turned out could not compete with Samsung on phone specs, and Qualcomm really screwed Microsoft with very bad windows drivers, full of bugs, and little to no support, so the phones would hang and freeze and with 3 companies in the picture all pointing fingers at each other - it was a real mess. So, Microsoft was stuck in the middle between Apple and Android, squeezed on both ends and with serious quality problems. It was really a huge business mistake to try and copy Apple. A free OS to compete with Android that was able to fully leverage the huge Win32 app platform, with C++ support from day one would have attracted better phone makers, and many more app developers. If the kernel was also Linux-based then developers could share app code across the 3 platforms and have a more manageable story for building, testing and shipping their apps on the 3 app stores. Microsoft could have acquired 3rd party libraries that emulate Win32 on Linux to enable easy porting of Win32 libraries so app developers could leverage the huge Windows legacy. This would have been a big job but if they started in 2003 they would have had time to do it right. So, what killed Windows Phone? Lack of vision to invest early back in 2003-2005. Then trying to copy Apple after they launched iPhone. Choosing to partner with Nokia and failing to partner Samsung. Choosing a source code incompatible Kernel (could not just recompile apps). Betting on .NET with no C++ story in the first release. UWP cutting off the huge legacy of Win32 apps. \u201cWindows\u201d was not a good brand name to use in a Phone. In other words a spectacular string of business and technical mistakes which should make a great case study for business schools. To highlight the lack of vision - I have a sneaking suspicion that Steve Jobs had a brilliant all up strategy where iPhone was only part of the overall vision. Starting with the most personal of devices, like iPods then iPhones, then building on the really strong personal attach these devices have, leverage that to create pull up into tablets, laptops and media centers. This has pulled Apple laptops from negligible numbers up into a respectable 9.5% of total laptops sold in 2017. Of both desktops + laptops, Apple had 12% of the global market share in 2018. That\u2019s a LOT of laptops. So if it was Steve Jobs\u2019 strategy to make macOS relevant by putting a phone in everyone\u2019s pocket, then it was a brilliant strategy that is clearly working. Did Steve Jobs really envision all this?

Do you need to call some Win32 API that you don\u2019t have permission to do from WinRT? Well WinRT itself does this using a separate service called the RuntimeBroker. Many WinRT objects use RPC to call into this broker process and do those things that need elevated privileges. I built a sample application that shows how to do this. Essentially it goes something like this: - Create a static C++ library containing a MIDL interface and compile it using /winrt to make it a windows runtime (WinRT) interface. - This generates RPC proxy stuff needed to marshal the interface across processes. Compile this into a new C++ DLL called \u201cYourInterface.ProxyStub.dll\u201d. You will register this dll using regsvr32 and this is needed for RPC to work. This proxy stub and the implementing broker dll will need to live in a location your WinRT app can access, like c:\\windows\\system32. - Next create a Universal C++ DLL called \u201cYourInterfaceBroker.dll\u201d \u2013 this will contain the implementation of the interface and is designed to run in the RuntimeBroker process. This DLL will be able to call out to Win32 and do interesting things. - Register the broker using a custom registry script. - Lastly create a C# Blank Universal WinRT application to test out your new interface, referencing the *.winmd that was generated by step 1. When you instantiate your new runtime class it is loaded into the RuntimeBroker process, and your C# app gets back the client proxy to it so each call to that object is marshalled automatically to the RuntimeBroker. See the sample code: WinRTServiceSample.zip . MIDL Interface Library In my sample I started with this static C++ library, I added a MIDL file called Microsoft.Service.Sample.idl, this defines the name of the .winmd so its namespace has to match the filename. I then used the MIDL Tab in the C++ properties to turn on \u201cEnable Windows Runtime\u201d /winrt compile option. The .winmd file is placed in the project output directory. I built it once and this also generates a dlldata.c and _i.c and _p.c files. I added those files to the project. To compile them it is easier if you just turn off the C++ option for precompiled headers. I also added the C++ preprocessor defines: WIN32;_WINDOWS;. So now you have a static library containing the RPC stubs needed later. For the purposes of this sample app I defined the following simple WinRT interface and runtime class: import \"inspectable.idl\"; import \"Windows.Foundation.idl\"; #ifndef NTDDI_WIN8 #define NTDDI_WIN8 0x06020000 #endif namespace Microsoft { namespace Service { namespace Sample { [uuid(C595230E-CB68-49EB-ACD1-70EE35B41D01)] [version(NTDDI_WIN8)] interface IMyService : IInspectable { HRESULT DoSomethingFun(); }; [ version(NTDDI_WIN8), activatable(NTDDI_WIN8), marshaling_behavior(agile), threading(both), ] runtimeclass MyService { [default] interface IMyService; } } } } ProxyStub I then added a C++ Win32 DLL project called MyService.ProxyStub. This dll has to include the above files again, but this time with the C++ preprocessor definition \u201cREGISTER_PROXY_DLL\u201d, and you need to generate a new GUID for your runtime class id (different from the one in the MIDL file) in a new ProxyEntry.c file as follows: // {xxxxxxxx-4CCC-4D4E-9C8C-A842DB7182E6} #define PROXY_CLSID_IS { 0xxxxxxxxx, 0x4ccc, 0x4d4e,{ 0x9c, 0x8c, 0xa8, 0x42, 0xdb, 0x71, 0x82, 0xe6 } }; #define USE_STUBLESS_PROXY #define PROXY_DELEGATION #include <rpcproxy.h> #include <ObjIdl.h> #include \"dlldata.c\" #include \"Microsoft.Service.Sample_i.c\" #include \"Microsoft.Service.Sample_p.c\" This is also easier to compile if you turn off precompiled headers. You also need to add a Module Definition file for the DLL containing: EXPORTS DllGetClassObject PRIVATE DllCanUnloadNow PRIVATE DllRegisterServer PRIVATE DllUnregisterServer PRIVATE You\u2019ll also need to add a VC++ Include Directory pointing at your interface static lib directory where the dlldata.c and _i.c and _p.c files got generated. You will also need to add the linker input \u201crpcrt4.lib\u201d. This generates the proxy stub needed for RPC to work. This dll will be registered using regsvr32. Broker Next I added a Universal C++ DLL project called \u201cMyServiceBroker\u201d. I added a reference to the static library project, I included #include <ObjIdl.h> in the pch.h file and again added the VC++ include directory where the _h.h file was generated. I wanted this DLL to work on the IoT SKU of Windows 10, which is why I used Universal DLL, but I want to run this outside an app container so I removed the following from the .vcxproj file: <AppContainerApplication>true</AppContainerApplication> . I also added the following linker instructions to each <Link> section: <IgnoreSpecificDefaultLibraries>comsuppwd.lib; comsuppw.lib; kernel32.lib; ole32.lib; user32.lib</IgnoreSpecificDefaultLibraries> <AdditionalDependencies>Wlanapi.lib;mincore.lib;onecoreuap.lib; WindowsApp.lib;</AdditionalDependencies> Lastly I added the a class that implements my new interface as follows: #pragma once #include <windows.h> #include <wrl.h> #include <MyInterface_h.h> namespace Microsoft { namespace Service { namespace Sample { class CMyService : public Microsoft::WRL::RuntimeClass<ABI::Microsoft::Service::Sample::IMyService, Microsoft::WRL::FtmBase> { InspectableClass(RuntimeClass_Microsoft_Service_Sample_MyService, PartialTrust); public: CMyService(); ~CMyService(); IFACEMETHOD(DoSomethingFun)(); private: CMyService(const CMyService&); const CMyService& operator = (const CMyService&); }; ActivatableClass(CMyService); } } } Then I added an empty implementation the the .cpp file. I also replaced the contents of the dllmain.cpp file with the following: #include \"pch.h\" #include <windows.h> #include <wrl.h> #include <wrl/module.h> using namespace Microsoft::WRL; STDAPI DllGetActivationFactory(_In_ HSTRING activatableClassId, _COM_Outptr_ IActivationFactory **factory) { return Module<ModuleType::InProcDisableCaching>::GetModule().GetActivationFactory(activatableClassId, factory); } _Check_return_ STDAPI DllGetClassObject(_In_ REFCLSID rclsid, _In_ REFIID riid, _Outptr_ LPVOID FAR* ppv) { return Module<ModuleType::InProcDisableCaching>::GetModule().GetClassObject(rclsid, riid, ppv); } STDAPI DllCanUnloadNow() { HRESULT hr = S_FALSE; if (Module<ModuleType::InProcDisableCaching>::GetModule().GetObjectCount() == 0) { hr = S_OK; } return hr; } STDAPI_(void) DllAddRef() { Module<ModuleType::InProcDisableCaching>::GetModule().IncrementObjectCount(); } STDAPI_(void) DllRelease() { Module<ModuleType::InProcDisableCaching>::GetModule().DecrementObjectCount(); } STDAPI_(BOOL) DllMain(_In_opt_ HINSTANCE hinst, DWORD reason, _In_opt_ void*) { if (reason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) { DisableThreadLibraryCalls(hinst); } return TRUE; } Setup First you need to copy your *ProxyStub.dll and your *Broker.dll to a place that the WinRT app can access (like c:\\windows\\system32) otherwise you will get E_ACCESSDENIED when trying to call object from WinRT. To register the broker I created a custom registry script containing the following. Notice the GUID used here matches the one I generated for the ProxyEntry.c file earlier. Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsRuntime\\ActivatableClassId\\Microsoft.Service.Sample.MyService] \"ActivationType\"=dword:00000000 \"CLSID\"=\"xxxxxxxx-4CCC-4D4E-9C8C-A842DB7182E6\" \"Threading\"=dword:00000000 \"TrustLevel\"=dword:00000001 \"DllPath\"=\"c:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\MyServiceBroker.dll\" [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsRuntime\\CLSID\\{xxxxxxxx-4CCC-4D4E-9C8C-A842DB7182E6}] \"ActivatableClassId\"=\"Microsoft.Service.Sample.MyService\" Running this from administrator command prompt makes it possible for WinRT to construct your runtime class. You may need to take ownership of the WindowsRuntime part of the registry in order to do this. There is a tool called TakeRegistryAdminOwnership.exe included in the above download that can help with this. C# App To test out my new brokered service I created a blank C# windows application and added a reference to the generated Microsoft.Service.Sample.winmd file, then added the following lines: var service = new Microsoft.Service.Sample.MyService(); service.DoSomethingFun(); When you run these lines the MyServiceBroker.dll is loaded into the RuntimeBroker.exe process (you can attach to that process using your VS debugger and watch it happen and you can debug your broker that way also). You will see RPC stuff on the stack when the DoSomethingFun call comes in. Don\u2019t worry about terminating the RuntimeBroker.exe process, it will auto-restart. Callbacks If you need to have your broker do something async and call back to your C# application later you can easily define a new interface, implement that in C# and pass it to your broker as an argument, then the broker can call that interface. This RPC interface will \u201ctimeout\u201d after a minute, so you may need to repeat that process periodically or do a heartbeat kind of thing to keep it alive. You could build a WinRT component project that wraps all this and exposes a new \u201cClient\u201d interface that turns all this callback stuff into C++/CX events so that it is easier to consume in your C# applications. Your \u201cClient\u201d interface could also expose C++/CX properties and events so you have a nice modern interface to your new broker.

I also replaced the contents of the dllmain.cpp file with the following: #include \"pch.h\" #include <windows.h> #include <wrl.h> #include <wrl/module.h> using namespace Microsoft::WRL; STDAPI DllGetActivationFactory(_In_ HSTRING activatableClassId, _COM_Outptr_ IActivationFactory **factory) { return Module<ModuleType::InProcDisableCaching>::GetModule().GetActivationFactory(activatableClassId, factory); } _Check_return_ STDAPI DllGetClassObject(_In_ REFCLSID rclsid, _In_ REFIID riid, _Outptr_ LPVOID FAR* ppv) { return Module<ModuleType::InProcDisableCaching>::GetModule().GetClassObject(rclsid, riid, ppv); } STDAPI DllCanUnloadNow() { HRESULT hr = S_FALSE; if (Module<ModuleType::InProcDisableCaching>::GetModule().GetObjectCount() == 0) { hr = S_OK; } return hr; } STDAPI_(void) DllAddRef() { Module<ModuleType::InProcDisableCaching>::GetModule().IncrementObjectCount(); } STDAPI_(void) DllRelease() { Module<ModuleType::InProcDisableCaching>::GetModule().DecrementObjectCount(); } STDAPI_(BOOL) DllMain(_In_opt_ HINSTANCE hinst, DWORD reason, _In_opt_ void*) { if (reason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) { DisableThreadLibraryCalls(hinst); } return TRUE; }","title":"Broker"},{"location":"posts/winrt_broker/#setup","text":"First you need to copy your *ProxyStub.dll and your *Broker.dll to a place that the WinRT app can access (like c:\\windows\\system32) otherwise you will get E_ACCESSDENIED when trying to call object from WinRT. To register the broker I created a custom registry script containing the following. Notice the GUID used here matches the one I generated for the ProxyEntry.c file earlier. Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsRuntime\\ActivatableClassId\\Microsoft.Service.Sample.MyService] \"ActivationType\"=dword:00000000 \"CLSID\"=\"xxxxxxxx-4CCC-4D4E-9C8C-A842DB7182E6\" \"Threading\"=dword:00000000 \"TrustLevel\"=dword:00000001 \"DllPath\"=\"c:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\MyServiceBroker.dll\" [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsRuntime\\CLSID\\{xxxxxxxx-4CCC-4D4E-9C8C-A842DB7182E6}] \"ActivatableClassId\"=\"Microsoft.Service.Sample.MyService\" Running this from administrator command prompt makes it possible for WinRT to construct your runtime class.

Happy Brokering!","title":"Callbacks"},{"location":"posts/wireless_remote/","text":"Wireless Remote Hack An Arduino hack on a cheap Wireless Remote Light Switch from Home Depot. So I bought this remote control switch from Home Depot a couple years ago: And the battery died in the remote, so I could go find a replacement A53G 12V battery, or I could hack it and control the remote using Arduino. That way I can turn the lights on and off by computer, based on time of sunset, etc, which is even better than the remote and exactly what I want. How hard could it be right? When you open up the remote it looks like a nice simple circuit, unfortunately no one seems to be able to find a datasheet for that IC labelled AUT980202-B1. But the transmitter is a common 315 MHz transmitter that you can even get from sparkfun , so that\u2019s promising. But since I don\u2019t know how the IC is driving the transmitter, it is time to break out the logic analyzer and take a look at the signal coming from the IC. The IC pin 2 seems to be the pin connected to the transmitter. There\u2019s a couple 0 ohm resistors connected to that trace, so let\u2019s probe there. Pretty soon you will see a set of simple signals at around 20 kHz, and it looks like there is an initial preamble, then the Off and On buttons produce the sequence 0x6814 and 0x6824. I had 3 of these remotes and when I looked at all of them I could see 0x68 prefix was in common, the next nibble 0x1 or 0x2 was the on off switch and the last nibble 0x0 to 0xF was the address of the remote switch, so you can do up to 16 unique remotes with this I guess. Ok, then I grabbed my trusty Arduino Leonardo and bit-banged out a similar signal until the logic analyzer matched as closely as possible. Here\u2019s the Arduino version: I noticed the original signal did the preamble, then the on or off sequence about 4 times with about 4 ms between each, then repeated with the preamble again. So I coded up a similar pattern and tried it out. It didn\u2019t work the first time, so I adjusted the timing to be as close as possible, then bingo, it worked as shown in this demo video: : I severed the link from the AUT980202 chip by removing a diode from the signal pin. This way I could use the Arduino to drive the signal instead. The next step was to bypass the buttons on the remote by soldering a wire to the transitor that controls the transmitter directly so the Arduino can decide when to turn the lights on or off, you can also hard wire the 5 volt output from the Arduino and remove the battery. Turns out 5 volts is enough and it still works. Lastly, I found that the older version of the remote, that I bought a couple years ago, was essentially the same but it runs the signal at about 2.7 times slower. Perhaps they change the signal speed every now and then to stop the devices from clashing, so no guarentee this code will work on your remote. But if you find the right scaling factor then you might get lucky. We need to use two GPIO pins on the Arduino, one to turn on or off the transmitter and another to drive the transmitted signal. #define SIGNAL_PIN 12 #define POWER_PIN 3 void setup() { // initialize digital pin SIGNAL_PIN as an output. pinMode(SIGNAL_PIN, OUTPUT); pinMode(POWER_PIN, OUTPUT); } My loop then turns the switch on then off, with a 1 second delay between each using this: void loop() { //float scale = 2.77; // old remote is slower. //uint8_t addr = 0x4; // south lights //uint8_t addr = 0xC; // north lights float scale = 1; uint8_t addr = 0x0; // new switch turnOn(addr, scale); delay(1000); turnOff(addr, scale); delay(1000); } The cool thing is this hacked remote can now turn on any of my remote switches simply by changing the 16 bit address, and/or the scale on the speed depending on whether I\u2019m controlling old or new switches. The turnOn and turnOff functions look similar: void turnOn(uint8_t addr, float scale) { digitalWrite(POWER_PIN, TOGGLE_ON); delay(1); uint16_t onSignal = makeSignal(true, addr); sendSignal(onSignal, scale); digitalWrite(POWER_PIN, TOGGLE_OFF); } void turnOff(uint8_t addr, float scale) { digitalWrite(POWER_PIN, TOGGLE_ON); delay(1); uint16_t offSignal = makeSignal(false, addr); sendSignal(offSignal, scale); digitalWrite(POWER_PIN, TOGGLE_OFF); } where the helper function makeSignal combines the prefix 0x68 with the on/off nibble and the address nibble: uint16_t makeSignal(bool on, uint8_t addr) { uint16_t signal = 0x68; signal <<= 4; if (on) { signal += 0x2; } else { signal += 0x1; } signal <<= 4; signal += (0xF & addr); return signal; } and the sendSignal function writes the preamble, and 4 repetitions of the signal, just to be sure. This seems reliable enough, but you could increase this repetition to whatever number you need to get 100% reliability. void sendSignal(uint16_t signal, float scale) { writePreamble(48, scale); delay(4); for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) { writeBits(signal, scale); delay((int)(4.0 * scale)); } } Ok, now down to the actual bit banging on the output line, simply raising it HIGH and LOW at the right time, the writePreamble does 48 fast pulses, at 200 microseconds: void writePreamble(int len, float scale) { for (int i = 0; i < len ; i++) { digitalWrite(SIGNAL_PIN, HIGH); delayMicroseconds((int)(200.0 * scale)); digitalWrite(SIGNAL_PIN, LOW); delayMicroseconds((int)(200.0 * scale)); } } And writeBits writes out our sequence (like 0x671C) by bit shifting over that signal. Each bit starts with a rising edge then for a 1 bit, it keeps the pulse high for 600 microseconds, for a 0 bit, it drops that after 200 microseconds and leaves it low for the remaining 400 microseconds, then there\u2019s a 200 microsecond low until the next bit. void writeBits(uint16_t signal, float scale) { for (int i = 0; i < 16 ; i++) { int bit = (signal & 0x8000); digitalWrite(SIGNAL_PIN, HIGH); if (bit) { delayMicroseconds((int)(610.0 * scale)); } else { delayMicroseconds((int)(200.0 * scale)); digitalWrite(SIGNAL_PIN, LOW); delayMicroseconds((int)(410.0 * scale)); } digitalWrite(SIGNAL_PIN, LOW); delayMicroseconds((int)(210.0 * scale)); signal <<= 1; } } The exact numbers used in these delayMicroseconds calls is needed to match the signal from the IC chip, and the lack of neat round numbers here is probably because the internal oscillators on the IC versus the Arduino are slightly different. But this seems to work. The scale factor in the code is just so that I can control old and new remote switches with the same code. See Arduino Source Code . Now hook that up to a nice little Python script to toggle the lights at sunrise and sunset: Python Source Code .
